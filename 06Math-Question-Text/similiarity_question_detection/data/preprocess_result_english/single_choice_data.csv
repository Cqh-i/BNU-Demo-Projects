1015,"Living and dealing with kids can be a hard job these days, but living and dealing with parents can be even harder.If I have learnt anything in my 16 years, it is that communication is very important, both when you disagree and when you get along. With any relationship(关系), you need to let the other person know how you are feeling. When you are mad at your parents, or anyone else, not talking to them doesn’t solve anything.Communication begins with the concern(关心) of another. It means that you can’t just come home from school, go up to your room and take no notice to anyone. Even though you just say “Hi”, and see how their day was for five minutes, it is better than nothing.When dealing with parents, you always have to make them feel good about how they are doing as a parent. If you are trying to make them see something as you see it, tell them that you’ll listen to what they have to say, and ask them politely to listen to you. Shouting or walking away only makes the situation worse.Here is an example: One night, Sophie went to a street party with her friends. She knew she had to be home by midnight after the fireworks, but she didn’t feel she could just ask to go home. That would be rude(粗鲁的). After all, they had been nice enough to take her along with. Needless to say(不用说), she was late getting home. Her parents were mad at first, but when Sophie explained why she was late, they weren’t as mad and let it go. Communication is the key here. Sophie was able to stay away trouble by communicating with her parents and having them see what she had seen.Communication isn’t a oneway matter, it goes both ways. Just remember: if you get into a situation like Sophie’s, telling the other person how you feellistening is the key to communication.The writer is probably a $$$A、fatherB、motherC、teenagerD、teacher "

1387,"PassageAIf you ask people to name the one person who had the greatest effect on the English language, you will get answers like “Shakespeare” “Samuel Johnson” and “Webster” but none of these men had any effect at all compared to a man who didn't even speak EnglishWilliam the Conqueror.Before 1066, in the land we now call Great Britain lived peoples belonging to two major language groups. In the westcentral region lived the Welsh, who spoke a Celtic language, and in the north lived the Scots, whose language, though not the same as Welsh, was also Celtic. In the rest of the country lived the Saxons, actually a mixture of Anglos, Saxons, and other Germanic and Nordic peoples, who spoke what we now call AngloSaxon or Old English, a Germanic language. If this state of affairs(状态)had lasted, English today would be close to German.But this state of affairs did not last. In 1066 the Normans led by William defeated the Saxons and began their rule over England. For about a century, French became the official language of England while Old English became the language of peasants. As a result, English words of politics and the law come from French rather than German. In some cases, modern English even showsadistinctionbetween upperclass French and lowerclass AngloSaxon in its words. We even have different words for some foods, meat in particular, depending on whether it is still out in the fields or at home ready to be cooked, which shows the fact that the Saxon peasants were doing the farming, while the upperclass Normans were doing most of the eating.When Americans visit Europe for the first time, they usually find Germany more “foreign” than France because the German they see on signs and advertisements seems much more different from English than French does. Few realize that the English language is actually Germanic in its beginning and that the French influences are all the result ofone man's ambition(抱负野心)What does“one man”in the last sentence refer to$$$A、Shakespeare.B、Samuel Johnson.C、Webster.D、William.

1980,"In China, Tomb Sweeping Day(清明节) gives you a holiday to go outdoors. In the USA, spring break(春假) is what teenagers look forward to.In China, school starts in late February or early March after the winter holiday, but American schools begin as early as January. So in late March and April, most American schools, from kindergartens to colleges, give students one to two weeks off school.What do students do during the time? They like to do many things, but they all beat studying!Some kids take trips with their parents, visiting a new state or even a new country. There is one place in the US that all kids dream about going on their Spring Break－Disney World in Florida. For some kids that dream will come true. They’ll get to meet Mickey Mouse.For many, spring break means relaxing or family reunions(团聚). They may stay home, read and watch movies, or they may go to visit friends. Others may travel to visit family members who live far away.Sometimes teachers lead(带领) groups of students to travel abroad. On a tenday trip, for example, students may go on a tour through Canada, France, and Italy. These trips are often expensive, but they give students a great chance to see other parts of the world.Students in the US don’t have their spring break at the same time. It depends on (取决于) where they live. So while students from one town are on vacation, their neighbors in the next town may have classes as usual.When do American teenagers have the spring break$$$A、In late February.B、In early March.C、In late March.D、In early January.

4030,"C篇“You'll get square eyes!” my mother used to say as I sat for hour after hour glued to the TV. I ignored her, of course. Pastforward a few decades and now I'm the parent. My 5yearold loves in a world where screens aren't fixed pieces of furniture. You can't even avoid them by going outside. Screens are not only in our pockets; they're everywhere.The concerns have grown with the screens. In the past decade, we have heard that they will damage our mental health. Many of us feel more distracted by them, feeling guiltier and tired as a result.The apps and websites we can access on our phones have also sparked widespread concern. Big tech companies are also good at making use of our need for social recognition, hooking us on likes, retweets and follower counts. Social media has created a culture of mass narcissism (自恋) , which has led many to worry about the emotional stresses on teenagers. A quick online search brings up dozens of papers linking screen use or social media with harmful effects on mental health,including depression and suicide.Such statements are alarming. They are also widely believed, thanks to popular books like iGen by Jean Twenge, which claims that digital technology has ruined a generation. Yet, Amy Orben at the University of Oxford, who studies the impact of digital technology and social media in particular om mental health, holds different views, She claims that the underlying data can be tell different stories. She also spotted shortcomings in several large studies that claimed to show correlations (相关性) between the use of devices with screens and depression in users.Twenge stands by her own finding, pointing in turn to what she considers flaws in Orben's research methods. For Davie Max, at Royal College of Child Health in London, the effect of screen time and social media use on mental health remains speculative.“We cannot regard social media overall as good or bad,”says Davie.“We don't know whether in individual cases social media is not responsible,”he says.The explosion of mobile phone use has revolutionized our lives. I can download movies, write article, communicate with my family and broadcast to the world all at the push of a button. Rather than impose constraints (限制), we should take a look at our use of screens and ask how they fit with the activities and lifestyles.Every new technology with widespread impact has given rise to new fears. So the best bet may simply be to ask yourself what level of screen use makes you and those around you happy and try to stick to it. If you find yourself over addictive, don't panicand certainly don't feel guilty. Nobody knows anything worth getting scared about.57 According to the passage, people give likes, retweet or count followers to$$$A、share one's lifestyles           B、show respect for othersC、seek social recognition           D、relieve emotional stresses "

4045,"A篇A vacation often means rest and relaxation, but more and more people are looking at traveling as an opportunity to help others and give back.Don Germaise is a familiar face to many in Tampa Bay, but this former TV reporter's life has changed a bit. “In the TV business you see the best and the worst the world has to offer, and at some point, it just occurred to me: I just need to do something to make the world a better place,” he explained.He now travels the world, volunteering his time to help others. “Here's the best part about a volunteer vacation. You're not stuck at a hotel doing tours that everyone else dose,” Cermaise said. “You're meeting regular people, living with regular people and helping regular people all over the word.”Travel Writer Joe Miragliotta says that's exactly why more people are spending time volunteering on vacation. “Travelers, especially millennials (千禧一代) like myself, are becoming more socially conscious when it comes to choosing where they go.” Miragliotta said. “They want to connect with the communities and causes they really care about.”He recently took some time out of a trip to San Francisco to help out at a local farm. “Here, volunteers are growing healthy foods for the community, and they give it right back for free; and you know you can tend the vegetable gardens, help clean the orchardlots of fun activities,” Miragliotta explained.Volunteering doesn't take up your entire vacation. You can do it for a few hours or even a few days. It's all up to you. “With a kid...when you do something as simple as giving him or her a pencil when they never had a pencil for school, the look in their eyes is so unbelievable.” Germaise said. “It's like they got an iPad for Christmas. It's the greatest feeling in the world.”49 What do vacation means to Don Germaise$$$A、Having a rest and relaxing.B、Getting an opportunity to travel.C、Meeting and helping regular people.D、Reporting on what happens around the world.

She hesitated when she brought the black folder to our table. My son opened the black folderit was. “You forgot the check,” he told her.“There isn't one. Someone elseyour billand the tip too.” she said with a giggle (咯咯笑)“Why?” asked our son, his wife and myself at once.“They loved it that no one was connected,” she continued. “They loved watching you guys. The old lady went on and on about how nice it was to see a family eating and talking instead of looking at ‘electric games'.”For a moment, everyone at our table was at a loss for. Then we all started talking at once. My son's voice rose above the others. “Where are they? We want to thank them.”“They left after you ordered dessert,” the waitress replied.We spent the next fifteen minuted discussing this goodness and came up with a.

4497,"B篇Georgia O'Keeffe always thought of herself as an artist. By 1928, the rest of the world did, too. At the age of 41 she was living in New York City and becoming a wellknown painter. Still, O'Keeffe wasn't happy. New York had been a good source of ideas for almost ten years. Now these ideas were drying up. O'Keeffe felt like she needed a change. She had visited New Mexico in 1917 with her sister. The wide open space had thrilled her. “Maybe I should go back,” she thought. In April of 1929, O'Keeffe packed her bags.The wide open space of New Mexico drew O'Keeffe in. She spent hours just watching the sky change. Because the light was so clear,she felt like she could see for the first time. The beauty of the land renewed her. She couldn't wait to start painting. Cow and horse skulls and desert flowers filled her canvases (画布) .“The colors up there is different,”she explained. She loved the dusty blues and greens.That August, O'Keeffe went to New York. It was the start of a pattern. Each spring,she traveled to New Mexico to paint. These trips restored her spirit. Then, in the fall, she wound return to New York. There, she showed her work. Each time O'Keeffe visited New Mexico, she explored a little more.The bleached animal bones and skulls that O'Keeffe found excited her because she could see their special beauty. The bones didn't mean death to O'Keeffe. To her, they showed the lasting beauty of the desert. The landscapes,clear light,and bright colors also spoke to her. She often painted closeups of the rocks and mountains. Later, she began to travel more in search of new ideas. However, she always came back to New Mexico.As O'Keeffe grew older,her eyesight began to fail. Still, O'Keeffe wasn't ready to give up. Her friend Juan Hamilton helped her work with watercolors. He also taught her to sculpt. As a result, she made art into 90s. When she died at the age of 98, Hamilton sprinkled her ashes over the desert. Her body became part of the land that had touched her art and her life.53O'Keeffe was unhappy in New York in 1928 because$$$A、she was lack of the creative ideasB、she felt disappointed about her jobC、she was not successful as an artistD、she felt bored about life in a big city "
