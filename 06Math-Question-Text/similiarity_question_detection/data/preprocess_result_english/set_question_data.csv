A young Arthur swung his arm as if he were playing tennis too. “I bet I could hit it really hard,” he thought.Arthur lived near a large park in Richmond, Virginia. His father was the manager of the park. He took care of the park and made sure everything was right. Arthur lived with his father and his brother.Arthur was allowed to play in the park when he was seven years old. He was small and athletic. A swimming pool, tennis courts, and baseball diamonds were in the park. Arthur spent a lot of time playing there. He did well in sports, but he had never tried to play tennis.He often watched the tennis players. Sometimes there were tennis lessons being given, and Arthur would watch even more carefully. The young man teaching the lessons noticed Arthur. His name was Ronald Charity.Mr. Charity asked Arthur if he wanted to learn to play tennis. Arthur was excited. Soon he was hitting the ball back and forth with Mr. Charity. Arthur was very fast and hit the ball hard. Mr. Charity could see that Arthur would grow up to be a good tennis player. By the time he was ten, Arthur won a tournament. Many older and bigger players came to the park trying to win the prize, but Arthur beat them. He became known as “the kid who could play tennis.”Arthur grew up to be one of the first successful AfricanAmerican tennis players. He played and won all over the world.

9016_0,"Read the passage and finish the following tasks.Yesterday's paper had a short article about the ComingofAgeceremony in a large city in Japan. According to the article, the mayor of the city formally apologized to an enraged professor who delivered a speech at the ceremony that was all but ignored by 20yearolds in the city.The officials prepared 7,000 seats in a gymnasium where the ceremony was held for the 17,000 twentyyearolds residing in the city. But most of the seats were empty during the speech. And many of the 20yearolds who did show up ignored the professor and spoke among themselves or talked on their mobile phones. Some even made a ruckus (骚动) outside the gymnasium.One 20yearold who attended the ceremony said youngsters came to the ceremony not to listen to speeches but to see their classmates. The mayor criticized the young generation at a news conference on Tuesday, saying such behavior ""issymbolic of the postwar era which failed to nurture healthy character and social intelligence.""Personally I feel people should not generalize the whole generation or the whole era when he criticizes something. But it is also true generation gap is getting bigger and bigger regarding the ceremony of ComingofAge Day. So far this ceremony has been held with citizens' tax money.

The idea of blessing new 20yearolds is not so bad. But there seems to be some other ways to celebrate more properly. The present way seems to me a little superficial and materialistic.

So I suggest giving the youth the chance to voice their opinions in the ceremony. Instead of listening to educators´lectures, selected young people can give speeches in the ceremony, talking about their growing pain, life experience, ambitions, understanding of adulthood, etc. Peer influence is the mosteffectiveeducation method. Performances such as singing, dancing, short plays can also be introduced into the ceremony, making it more attractive, colourful and active."

9031_0,"阅读Read the passage and finish the following tasks.Pole2Pole – Sailing on Pangaea in Atlantic OceanLiving life gets a new meaning only when you can exist by being who you are. To be free is and certainly will forever be one of the most desired needs of mankind. History has taught us a lot of what we know today about the word freedom. The word freedom has nearly become an obscenity(猥亵言辞) and is slowly disappearing like the morning fog. The question is the following: What price am I willing to pay to be able to live with a certain amount of freedom? And what will I do with the luxury of freedom if I couldacquire it? I guess the trick question is, how do you define being free?The big dilemma of growing up is that we lose our dreams, with that we lose our freedom. The solution to the dilemma is very simple in theory: Grow older but keep on dreaming like a child.My father told me that if your dreams don't scare you, they are not big enough. How can man ever sleep, if his dreams keep on eluding him? Freedom often gets imprisoned in our mind purely by ourselves and how we think.Action is the key word that liberates the mind. To be free, you need action.We often speak about luxury as something we cannot afford. The new luxury in today's world is freedom; it can be bought without a currency. We can buy freedom by changing the way we think! We often move from one situation to another, thinking we will have more time only to realise that we don't. It is like having six of one or a half a dozen of another. One day will always have 24 hours and that's the same for each human being on earth, we all have the same amount of time. How we use it is a different question.Working with freedom, doing what you love, staying true to yourself, trying to do what you always wanted to do, reaching success or failure, learning from it, is all forms of mental freedom. Take a moment to look at your life, find what ties you down, doing your best at what you do, start loving the hard and difficult moments, helps us to free up our mind.We should not always think that by having more time is the only form of freedom. Liberate yourself mentally to take on challenges and responsibilities. It makes you feel good about yourself.In short, enjoy being yourself and love what you do. It will make you happy, and a happy man is a free man.When you have worked hard for what you want, and then acquire it, you often realise that you do not have enough time to use what you have acquired. That belief frustrates and imprisons us. The freedom of enjoying what we worked for, without the pleasure of the action of using it has the reverse effect of what we imagined it to be like when we started pursuing our pathway to freedom. We often say when I have this I will do that… and we find ourselves with no time to do the “that”. This is where the game changes in our mind.Instead of thinking of only enjoying the action part we should enjoy the whole process of acquiring as well, in fact enjoy everything we do in the ideal situation.

To be free is and certainly will forever be one of the most desired needs of mankind. History has taught us a lot of what we know today about the word freedom. The word freedom has nearly become an obscenity(猥亵言辞) and is slowly disappearing like the morning fog. The question is the following: What price am I willing to pay to be able to live with a certain amount of freedom? And what will I do with the luxury of freedom if I couldacquire it? I guess the trick question is, how do you define being free?The big dilemma of growing up is that we lose our dreams, with that we lose our freedom. The solution to the dilemma is very simple in theory: Grow older but keep on dreaming like a child.My father told me that if your dreams don't scare you, they are not big enough. How can man ever sleep, if his dreams keep on eluding him? Freedom often gets imprisoned in our mind purely by ourselves and how we think.Action is the key word that liberates the mind. To be free, you need action.We often speak about luxury as something we cannot afford. The new luxury in today's world is freedom; it can be bought without a currency. We can buy freedom by changing the way we think! We often move from one situation to another, thinking we will have more time only to realise that we don't. It is like having six of one or a half a dozen of another. One day will always have 24 hours and that's the same for each human being on earth, we all have the same amount of time. How we use it is a different question.Working with freedom, doing what you love, staying true to yourself, trying to do what you always wanted to do, reaching success or failure, learning from it, is all forms of mental freedom. Take a moment to look at your life, find what ties you down, doing your best at what you do, start loving the hard and difficult moments, helps us to free up our mind.We should not always think that by having more time is the only form of freedom. Liberate yourself mentally to take on challenges and responsibilities. It makes you feel good about yourself.In short, enjoy being yourself and love what you do. It will make you happy, and a happy man is a free man.When you have worked hard for what you want, and then acquire it, you often realise that you do not have enough time to use what you have acquired. That belief frustrates and imprisons us. The freedom of enjoying what we worked for, without the pleasure of the action of using it has the reverse effect of what we imagined it to be like when we started pursuing our pathway to freedom. We often say when I have this I will do that… and we find ourselves with no time to do the “that”. This is where the game changes in our mind.Instead of thinking of only enjoying the action part we should enjoy the whole process of acquiring as well, in fact enjoy everything we do in the ideal situation. Certainly there will be different levels of enjoyment.Live in the moment, do not always want to be somewhere else, it liberates your mind and adds to the happiness that makes us feel free!

But now that information is being spread and monitored(监控) in different ways, researchers are discovering new rules. By tracking people's emails and online posts, scientists have found that good news can spread faster and farther than disasters and sob stories. ＂The ‘if it bleeds' rule works for mass media,＂says Jonah Berger, a scholar at the University of Pennsylvania.＂They want your eyeballs and don't care how you're feeling. But when you share a story with your friends, you care a lot more how they react. You don't want them to think of you as a Debbie Downer.＂ Researchers analyzing wordofmouth communicationemails,Web posts and reviews, facetoface conversationsfound that it tended to be more positive than negative(消极的), but that didn't necessarily mean people preferred positive news. Was positive news shared more often simply because people experienced more good things than bad things? To test for that possibility, Dr. Berger looked at how people spread a particular set of news stories: thousands of articles on The New York Times' website. He and a Penn colleague analyzed the＂most emailed＂list for six months. One of his first findings was that articles in the science section were much more likely to make the list than nonscience articles. He found that science amazed Times' readers and made them want to share this positive feeling with others. Readers also tended to share articles that were exciting or funny, or that inspired negative feelings like anger or anxiety, but not articles that left them merely sad. They needed to be aroused(激发) one way or the other, and they preferred good news to bad. The more positive an article, the more likely it was to be shared, asDr. Berger explains in his new book,＂Contagious: Why Things Catch On.＂###While choosing a piece of news or a story to spread, why do mass media and ordinary people have a totally opposite opinion###Because social media only aims to catch the readers' eyes but doesn't care their feeling, while ordinary people care a lot about how their friends react when their friend hear the story they shared."

What a colorful life andwhatanunforgettableexperience!I would like to call myself a professional farmer. Now I'm not only a helper onKathy's farm, for I bought my own farm half a year ago! I love my farm so much. Crops, cows, horse, and tractors all magically attract my heart. Every morning I get up early and start my work on the farm happily. I'm an experienced horse rider and tractor driver now. Since there is so much work to do, I even hire five helpers. I don't think we are just employer and employees. Actually, we are friends—friends who are all passionate about nature and farm.To enlarge my farm's business and let more city people have the chance to be close to nature, I opened my farm to the city tourist last month. Anyone interested in farm life can book a one-week or even longer holiday on my farm, where they can not only ride horses, feed animals, but also try farm work! Is it attractive to you? Come on! Escape the busy and boring city life. Come and relax with me on my farm!So far I think leaving the city and starting my life here is the best choice I have ever made in my life. I can experience so much on the farm and my life turns out to be meaningful again! I will continue with my life here and grow with my farm day by day!"

Children with measles may get killed or disabled. Although the disease was nearly wiped out but it is making a comeback. This month, 22 measles were reported, which was caused by the outbreak last year. So it is strongly recommended that your child should be vaccinated before entering kindergarten. It's true that there is a risk when getting vaccinated, but actually it is very small. As long as we all share the risk, we can enjoy the life-saving benefits vaccines provides."

Believe it or not, sleepwalking is not an unusual problem, according to a new study published in Neurology, a medical journal, on May 14.Scientists from Stanford University, US, interviewed 19,136 people aged 18 and older from 15 states. They found that about 30 percent of people had sleepwalked before.Sleepwalking is a kind of sleep problem. Everyone has a sleep cycle. It lasts between 90 and 120 minutes and repeats all night. The cycle (周期) is divided into REM (rapideyemovement) sleep and nonREM sleep.During REM sleep, our brains are active; that’s when we dream. During nonREM sleep, the brain´s activity starts to slow down. This is when some people suddenly get out of bed and walk around.A sleepwalker has a “sleeping brain and an awake body,” Donna Arand, scientist at Kettering Medical Center, US, told The Washington Post.“Sleepwalkers tend to do daytime activities,” she said. These can be simple things, or things as difficult as driving, making sandwiches, sending emails and making phone calls.Scientists still don´t know exactly why people sleepwalk. But this recent study found some causes. The participants (参与者) in the study answered questions about their sleepwalking history, medicine use, other sleep habits and medical conditions.Among those interviewed, those who got fewer than seven hours of sleep per night tended to sleepwalk more.Some medicines, such as sleeping pills, can increase the risk of sleepwalking. People with depression (抑郁症) were 3.5 times more likely to sleepwalk than those without.

But he couldn´t work out the right way to go.It was now getting dark and he was a long way from any place of safety. He knew that he might die that night in the cold temperatures.

Outside his hole, the temperature fell to a dangerous15℃that night, but inside it Jake was safe from the cold.But he had to get down the mountain. The TV programmes always said,“ If you are lost, you should find someone else´s tracks(足迹) through the snow and follow them.” “I wanted to live my life.” remembers Jake. “So I got up and I found some ski tracks and I followed those.” He walked and walked and finally he saw lights.

9085_0,"C      A group of bluefaced birds step through the grass shoulder to shoulder, red eyes looking around. They look like middle schoolers seeking a cafeteria table at lunchtime. Perhaps they're not so different.A new study, led by Damien Farine, an ornithologist who studies collective behaviour, shows that the vulturine guineafowl of eastern Africa, like humans, have multilevel societies. In the past, scientists assumed such social structures required a lot of brainpower. But the peabrained guineafowl are revealing the faults in that assumption.These large birds wander across the landscape in packs, often walking so closely that their bodies touch. They may fight each other to maintain their strict hierarchies (等级制度), but at other times they engage in friendly behaviours like sharing food.Suspecting the guineafowl might have a social structure, Dr. Farine and his colleagues began a thorough study of their society. For a whole year, they made daily observations of 441 birds. Coloured leg bands in unique combinations let researchers tell the blackandblue birds apart. They also attached GPS devices to the backs of 58 birds, which let them see exactly where every group went, 24 hours a day.The findings of the research suggest that the vulturine guineafowl have a multilevel society. There are groups within groups within the population as a whole. There even seem to be groups of friends within the small groups. This is the first time anyone has observed such a society in a bird.And Dr. Farine emphasizes this particular bird's tiny brain size: “They don't only have small brains relative to mammals (哺乳动物), they also have quite small brains relative to other birds,” he said.According to him, living in this kind of society might actually make it easier to keep track of the social order. For example, if groups are stable and a bird can identify just one or two individuals within a group, it knows which group it's looking atno need for a brain that can recognize every single animal. Multilevel societies also let animals adjust their group sizes based on whatever challenges they're facing. Depending on what enemies or resources are around, it might make sense to travel in a combined group rather than a smaller one.“Having a multilevel structure may not require having a large brain,” Dr. Farine said. There may be more birds and other animals out there that, although smallbrained, have societies as manyleveled as our own###{38}According to the passage, what inspired Dr. Farine to carry out the study###A、The guineafowl's social behaviour.B、Previous assumptions about birds.C、His interest in animal brainpower.D、The faults in earlier research.

9094_0,"阅读题阅读短文回答问题News means""Newsworthy information about recent events or happenings, especially as reported by news media"". But what makes news newsworthy?There is a list of some factors, which are considered when deciding if a story is newsworthy. When an editor needs to decide whether to run with a particular story, s/he will ask how well the story meets each of the criteria (标准). Normally, a story should perform well in at least two areas.TimeThe wordnewsmeans exactly that things which arenew. Topics which are current are good news. Consumers are used to receiving the latest updates, and there is so much news about that old news is quickly discarded.A story with only average interest needs to be told quickly.If it happened today, it's news. If the same thing happened last week, it's no longer interesting.Significance (意义)The number of people affected by the story is important. A plane crash in which hundreds of people died is more significant than a crash killing a dozen.Proximity（距离）Stories which happen near to us have more significance. The closer the story to home, the more newsworthy it is. For someone living in France, a major plane crash in the USA has a similar news value to a small plane crash near Paris.Note that proximity doesn't have to mean geographical distance. Stories from countries with which we have a particular bond or similarity have the same effect. For example, Australians would be expected to be more interested in a story from a distant Western nation than a story from a much closer Asian country.Human InterestHuman interest stories are a bit of a special case. They often disregard the main rules of newsworthiness; for example, they don't date as quickly, they need not affect a large number of people, and it may not matter where in the world the story takes place.Human interest stories appeal to emotion. They aim to get responses such as amusement or sadness. Television news programs often place a humorous or quirky story at the end of the show to finish on a feelgood note. Newspapers often have a dedicated area for offbeat or interesting items###What does the underlined part mean in paragraph 3###A、is soon thrown away  B、is read  C、is forgotten slowly D、is remembered "

They put into the earth chemicals to help release the natural gas. However,thiscan cause earthquakes because the chemicals stay underground may lead to an earthquake.An example of this can be seen in the state of Oklahoma in the United States.As drilling became more frequent in 2011, so did the number of earthquakes. In fact, in 2008 there were only about 12 earthquakes reported. In 2011, this number increased tomore than 1,000 earthquakes just in one year.Dams and reservoirs（水库）, which can be found all over the world can also lead to earthquakes.Their main purpose is to store water for future use and generate electricity. Some dams can hold large quantities of water. This water is extremely heavy, powerful and contains a massive amount of potential energy concentrated all in one area. Given the right conditions, the power of water can induce an earthquake. The 2008 earthquake in Sichuan, China left over 70,000 dead and is believed to have been caused by the construction of the nearby Zipingpu Dam. In many places around the world, water can be found underground. Groundwater extraction（抽取）, such as a well, is common and safe, however, it can be dangerous and cause earthquakes if extraction is done at a quicker rate than the underground reservoir can be recharged.For example, in 2011, there was a 5.1 magnitude earthquake in Lorca, Spain was caused by excessive groundwater extraction.It is certainly hard to believe that certain buildings can possibly lead to earthquakes.However, this is true. In Taiwan, the Taipei 101 tower was built in 2002 to be able to survive earthquakes and typhoons.The building is sitting on soft rock and the materials used for this building are very heavy.Ridiculously, geologists believe this building has been causing earthquakes in the area. In fact, there was one earthquake at the site during construction, two large earthquakes directly below the building, and two smaller earthquakes in the area.Overall, there are different ways that humans can cause earthquakes and it is important to keep in mind the effect humans can have on the environment###What is the passage mainly about###A、Main reasons for earthquakes.B、Damage caused by earthquakes.C、Humans´ influence on earthquakes.

Could we survive from this natural disaster? Imagine the possible situation. Write it down as well as your opinion on humans´ relationship with nature. Use proper words and grammars, such as inversion（倒装）, emphaticsentence（强调句）, or passive voice（被动语态） to help you express your opinion###Possible answers:I´m living in a large city with millions of tall buildings, which were built with theseismicdesign. If a large earthquake hit the city I live, I think most of the building will stay up. The large quake would cause damage. However, with the science of earthquake prediction, most of people would get prepared. In another word, I don´t think humans are helpless in front of nature. Humans have a close relationship with nature. We can´t go without nature. It is nature that produced and feed us humans. Living in this world, besides the basic needs like foods and clothes, humans have various requirements to make life comfortable and colorful. Only from nature can we get what we need. However, nature is not always kind to humans. Every year, thousands of people are killed in natural disasters.Volcanoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, drought, tornadoes and earthquakes happen all the time. Faced with natural disasters, humans appear so small and helpless. Fortunately, thanks to the development of science and technology, we can predict most of natural disasters and take actions to protect ourselves. Meanwhile, it is important to keep in mind the effect humans can have on the environment. The destruction of nature will definitely lead to nature´s revenge, causing more natural disasters. Protecting nature is protecting ourselves. Humans need to keep a balanced relationship with nature."

As Dad became weaker and weaker, I had to take up his gardening work. Dad was dying. The rows and rows of colorful vegetables were gone.For the first few years after he died, I couldn´t even stand to look at anyone´s garden, for fear that the memories would hurt me.

9110_0,"Simple Body Language Boosts Your CareerBody language is one of the most important and powerful ways of communication in the history of the world. A simple raised hand in front of your face tells everyone that you are not going to put up with what is happening any more. How can we use body language to help your career? Here are several suggestions for you.To make a difficult task seem easier, smile.By smiling, you are tricking yourself into thinking that you are enjoying this very difficult task. Whatever the task is, when you are frown while doing it, you are sending your brain the message, “This is really difficult, I should stop.” The brain then responds by sending chemical signs of stress into your bloodstream. And this creates a vicious circle: the more stressed you are, the more difficult the task becomes. But if you smile, you will start thinking that this task is really not so bad.To reduce resistance, hand out your business cards.If you are standing in a room with your arms folded and your eyes looking down, no one will approach you. Sitting with your legs crossed gives the same signal. However, if you behave naturally by giving them a card or by getting them a cup a coffee when people come into the room, this will lessen the resistance.To increase participation, show you're paying attention.If you want to show people you are listening, put down your phone! You can show your attention by turning your head to face them directly or by making your eye contact. Leaning forward and nodding your head are other ways to show you're engaged and paying attention.To connect instantly with someone, shake hands.A handshake is the foundation of a good communication. A study found that people are more likely to remember you if you shake hands with them. Touch is the most powerful body language. Touching someone on the arm, hand, or shoulder for as little as 1/40 of a second creates human relations. In the workplace, physical touch is usually established through shaking hands, and this contact makes a lasting and positive impression.To improve your speech, use your hands.Though sometimes people say that making too many movements with your hands implies nervousness, but that is OK if you are doing it in the right way. Since gesture is closely linked to speech, gesturing as we talk can actually power up our thinking###What does the word “boost” in the title mean?

But if you smile, you will start thinking that this task is really not so bad.To reduce resistance, hand out your business cards.If you are standing in a room with your arms folded and your eyes looking down, no one will approach you.

Leaning forward and nodding your head are other ways to show you're engaged and paying attention.To connect instantly with someone, shake hands.A handshake is the foundation of a good communication. A study found that people are more likely to remember you if you shake hands with them. Touch is the most powerful body language. Touching someone on the arm, hand, or shoulder for as little as 1/40 of a second creates human relations. In the workplace, physical touch is usually established through shaking hands, and this contact makes a lasting and positive impression.To improve your speech, use your hands.Though sometimes people say that making too many movements with your hands implies nervousness, but that is OK if you are doing it in the right way.

9110_3,"Simple Body Language Boosts Your CareerBody language is one of the most important and powerful ways of communication in the history of the world. A simple raised hand in front of your face tells everyone that you are not going to put up with what is happening any more. How can we use body language to help your career? Here are several suggestions for you.To make a difficult task seem easier, smile.By smiling, you are tricking yourself into thinking that you are enjoying this very difficult task.

Could youshow us an example about it in your daily life###Personally, Ithink all of the suggestions are useful in our daily life when we are communicate with others. But what I value most is that we should show we are paying attention to others, which is often ignored by most people. Paying attention to others shows that we respect others and can help us get important information while we are communicating with others.Nowadaysmany teenagers bury their heads in playing cellphones while talking with others, which is really impolite. When we talk or chat with our parents, our teacher or our friends, we should put down our phone, make eye contact and listen to what they are talking attentively to show our respect to others and to be engaged in the conversation."

By 2016, the Yellowstone wolf population had grown to more than 170.Gray wolves once were seen here and there in the Yellowstone area and other pans of United States, but they were graduallydisplacedby human development. By the 1920s, wolves had disappeared from the Yellowstone area. They went farther north into (he deep forests of Canada, where there were fewer humans around. The disappearance of the wolves had many unexpected results. Deer and elk populationsmajor food sources for the wolfgrew rapidly. These animals ate large amounts of plants, which reduced plant diversity in the park. With the disappearance of gray wolves, coyote (草原狼) populations also grew quickly. The coyotes killed a great number of red foxes in the park, and completely drove away the park’s beavers (河狸).As early as 1966, biologists asked the government to consider reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone Park. They hoped that wolves would be able to control the elk and coyote problems. Many framers were against the plan because they feared that wolves would kill their farm animals or pets.The government spent nearly 30 years thinking lip a plan to reintroduce the wolves. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service carefully monitors and manages the wolf packs in Yellowstone. Today, the debate continues over how well the gray wolf is fitting in at Yellowstone. Elk, deer, and coyote populations are down, while beavers and red foxes have made a comeback.

I began my almost 400mile journey on November 1st1997. I walked and skied alone. My dog team were not with me to pull my sled(雪橇).Another journey of challenge and danger was about to begin.The first days the weather was very good. The wind was icy but not very strong and there was bright sunshine 24 hours a day.But changes were just around the corner.On the third day I was struggling through stormy weather and during the next week the wind grew stronger and I found myself spending a whole day in my tent.I had traveled only two hours one day when the winds increased so much that I had to put my tent up before the winds became too strong. Within a few minutes the winds increased to a howling storm that threatened to blow me and my tent away, but none of that happened.On November 12ththe storm died down. It was my birthday and I wanted to make that day special. I thawed (解冻) a frozen cake over my fireplaced a candle on the toplit it and sang “happy birthday to me” at the top of my voice.A few days later, I was moving forward over a slope that seemed safe when suddenly without warning my world dropped out from under my skis. I had fallen into a hole and was hanging on the ropes tied to the sled. A piece of ice fell down and I never heard it land. The bottom was a few hundred feet below. I used to practice selfrescue many times in the mountains where I live and carefully began climbing out. It took a long time but I finally got out. I was thankful for all the training I had had. I was in good health and all of my equipment was working well. I was so optimistic that I decided that the next daythe 22ndday of the expeditionI would increase my workday to 12 hours.The next morning, I had a bad accident with the sled and hurt my leg. I couldn't stand on my left leg and my head was woozy from hitting the ground. But I knew that I had to get up. Lying on the iceI would soon die. I struggled to my knees knowing that somehow I had to put my tent up for shelter. On hands and knees I got the tent up and dragged my sleeping bag into the tent and lay down out of the cold wind.I had to make a decision. Wait to get better or give up###Choose the right order of the following events.a I fell into a hole.b I struggled through stormy weather.c I travelled to the North Pole.d I hurt my leg.e I travelled to the Antarctica.f I celebrated my birthday with a frozen cake alone###A、c, e, b, a, d, fB、e, c, f, b, a, dC、c, e, b, f, a, dD、e, c, f, b, a, d "

Give reasons###I think traveling to the Antarctica alone is too risky, because it is freezing, the wind is strong and the stormy weather always lasts a few days. In addition, traveling there alone is more dangerous. There are potential dangers, such as ice holes covered with thick snow. If you fall into the hole, you will be badly injured or killed. So I think going there alone is too dangerous."

To engineer such a machine, the brothers and others before them took inspiration from birds, studying the physics of bird flight and the behavioral methods used by birds to control flight once in the air. Yet a century later, in an ironic twist, birds within a particular group  the seabirds  have become vulnerable to disturbance from the very machines they inspired.Airplanes, helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles (e.g. drones) approaching too close to seabird colonies can disturb seabirds through their loud noise and even just their physical proximity. When such disturbances are repeated or severe, they can affect the conservation, recovery, and longterm health of an entire colony by elevating stress levels in seabirds and making them more vulnerable to the already stressful conditions they naturally endure  harsh weather and an unpredictable food supply. Disturbing seabirds results in other and perhaps less obvious risks. When birds are flushed from their nests, their eggs become exposed to the elements  to cold and windy weather  and to predators, such as gulls and ravens.For this reason, the Seabird Protection Network (Network) is proud to be partnering with local pilots who are doing their part to protect seabirds by reducing disturbance and spreading wildlifefriendly practices throughout their community. Among our most active partners is Gretchen Kelly, the manager of the Half Moon Bay and San Carlos airports. Over the past several years, Gretchen has shared our conservation messages with hundreds, perhaps even thousands of pilots. In addition, through her leadership, Network staff have had the opportunity to attend the pilot briefing at the Pacific Coast Dream Machines event for the past several years. Our presence at the briefing gives us the opportunity to remind pilots about sensitive wildlife areas and to encourage pilots to fly at or above 1,000ft AGL in such areas. We are excited to announce that this year, because of Gretchen's efforts as well as those of the other pilots participating in Dream Machines, there was not a single aircraft disturbance to the nearby Common Murre seabird colony on Devil's Slide Rock. This is a first for this particular colony, so here at the Network we are definitely celebrating. Thank you, pilots!###What can the disturbance from the planes result in###A、Birds may fell down form their nests.B、Birds may be short of food.C、Birds may be driven away from their colony. "

This is why we are generally justified in not worrying too much if a single scientist, even a very famous one, disagrees with the claim. And this is why diversity in sciencethe more people looking at a claim from different anglesis important.Does this process ever go wrong? Of course. Scientists are humans. There is always the possibility of revising a claim on the basis of new evidence. Some people argue that we should not trust science because scientists are “always changing their minds.” While examples of truly settled science being overturned are far fewer than is sometimes claimed, they do exist. But the beauty of this scientific process is that it explains what might otherwise appear paradoxical (矛盾的): that science produces both novelty and stability. Scientists do change their minds in the face of new evidence, but this is a strength of science, not a weakness###{45}Which of the following would be the best title for the passage###A、Put Your Faith in ScienceB、Defend the Truth in ScienceC、Apply Your Mind to ScienceD、Explore A Dynamic Way to Science "

He pointed to a window at the top, “Look, there´s a face,” he said. Everyone looked, but the face had gone.“It can´t be a face,” said Gran, “The castle is empty.” They went into the castle. “It looks very old,” said Biff.“And very scary!” said Kipper.“Let´s play hide and seek,” said Chip. The children ran in and out of the rooms.“I´ll play too,” said Gran, and she went into the next room. Gran looked for a place to hide. She saw a gate and pulled it open.CLANG! The gate banged shut. Gran pushed it, but it was stuck.“Help! Help!” she shouted. The children ran to see what had happened.“I´m trapped,” said Gran. The gate was very stiff. The children pulled and pulled. At last, it opened.“I´ll keep the gate open with this old chest,” said Gran. “I don´t want to be trapped again.”“Come on,” said Kipper. “Let´s see where these stairs go.”They all went up the stairs.

9162_0,"During the Middle Ages, few scholars questioned beliefs that had been long held. Europeans based their ideas on what ancient Greeks and Romans believed or on the Bible. People still thought that the earth was the center of the universe. They believed that the sun, moon, other planets, and stars moved around it. In the mid1500s, attitudes began to change. Scholars started the Scientific Revolution. It was a new way of thinking about the natural world. It was based on careful observation and the willingness to question old beliefs. European voyages of exploration helped to bring about the Scientific Revolution. When Europeans explored new lands, they saw plants and animals that ancient writers had never seen. These discoveries led to new courses of study in the universities of Europe.The first challenge to accepted thinking in science came in astronomy. In early 1500s, Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer, studied the stars and planets. He developed a heliocentric theory. Heliocentric meant suncentered. It said that earth, like all the other planets, moved around the sun. Copernicus did not publish his findings until just before his death. He had been afraid that his ideas would be attacked. They went against the long accepted theory which held that the earth was at the center of the universe. In the early 1600s, Johannes Kepler used mathematics to prove that Copernicus's basic idea was correct. An Italian scientist – Galileo Galilei made one of the first telescopes and used it to study the planets. He found that Jupiter had moons, the sun had spots, and Earth's moon was rough. Some of his ideas about the earth, the sun, and the planets went against the teaching of the Catholic Church. Church authorities forced Galileo to take back his statements. Still, his ideas spread.Interest in science led to the scientific method. With this method, scientists ask a question based on something they have seen in the physical world. They form a hypothesis(假设), or an attempt to answer the question. Then they test they hypothesis by making experiments or checking other facts. Finally, they change the hypothesis if needed. The English writer Francis Bacon helped create this new approach to knowledge. He said scientists should base their thinking on what they can observe and test. The French mathematician Rene Descartes also influenced the use of the scientific method. His thinking was based on logic(逻辑) and mathematics.In the mid1600s, the English scientist Isaac Newton described the law of gravity. Using mathematics, Newton showed that the same force ruled both the motion of planets and the action of bodies on the earth.One invented the microscope. Others invented tools for understanding weather.One made drawings that showed the different parts of the human body. Another learned how the heart pumped blood through the body. In the late 1700s, Edward Jenner first used the process called vaccination(接种疫苗) to prevent disease. By giving a person the germs from a cattle disease called cowpox, he helped that person avoid getting a more serious human disease of smallpox.One questioned the old idea that things were made of only four elements – earth, air, fire, and water.

I knew it was an emergency.” It certainly was, Paris had suffered a sudden heart failure. Without immediate medical care, Paris would die. At first no one moved. The girls were in shock. Then the softball coach shouted out, “Does anyone know CPR?” CPR is a lifesaving technique. To do CPR, you press on the sick person's chest so that blood moves through the body and takes oxygen to organs. Without oxygen the brain is damaging quickly.Amazingly, Taylor had just taken a CPR course the day before. Still, she hesitated. She didn't think she knew it well enough.

9177_0,"阅读题Maria MartinezPotterMaria Martinez is remembered today as the maker of beautiful pottery. Her pottery is in museums all over the world. The pots she made are black with shiny designs on them.Maria Martinez was a Tewa Native American. She was born around 1881. Maria lived in San Ildefonso, New Mexico. As a young woman, Maria was known for the fine pots she made. Maria and the other village women made pots for their families. They also sold pots to visitors. Compared to the pots made by the other women, young Maria’s were lovely. But they were not outstanding. They were not the pots that would make the name Maria Martinez known around the world.In 1908, special visitors came to Maria’s village. The visitors were archaeologists(考古学家). They were looking for remains of early NativeAmerican life. The visitors had been digging near Maria’s village. During the dig, they had found broken bits of pottery. The pots had belonged to a group of Native Americans who had lived there seven hundred years before.One of the archaeologists showed Maria the pieces of broken pots. They were thinner than the pots Maria was making. They had an odd, shiny black finish. He asked Maria if she could make such a pot. He wanted it to be just like a sevenhundredyearold pot. Maria said she would try.Maria’s husband, Julian, helped her. First they had to find a way to make the wall of the pot thinner. Maria knew that the clay(黏土) she was using would not work. A thin pot made out of that clay would crack when it was fired. Maria mixed different amounts of clay, sand, and water. At last, she discovered a mix that would not crack.Maria and Julian then had to find out how the shiny black finish had been made. They discovered that it took two steps. First, Maria began by polishing(抛光) the dried clay surface of the pot with a smooth stone. It was slow work. Then, when the pot was polished, she placed it in a fire that was built in a certain way. The fire and ashes worked their magic on the pot. Its finish was now shiny and black.Maria and Julian had discovered the secrets of the early pottery makers. The search for the secrets had excited Maria. She was eager to make more pots in the old way. And she did. For more than seventy years, Maria stayed in her village making pots.Maria produced many pots in her lifetime. Under Maria’s direction her son and grandson also learned how to make beautiful pots. They are keeping the old ways alive just as Maria had done before them###After the archaeologists met Maria, she ###A、soon became world famousB、continued making regular potsC、discovereda pot of 700 years oldD、began to try making ancient pots "

9191_0,"阅读题Lisa Klein spends much of her time sorting out mountains of brightly colored baby clothes, folding tiny Tshirts. For most parents, this is pretty ordinary, but Klein has a larger purpose: She’s getting infant clothing to mothers in need.She was inspired a few days after Hurricane（飓风） Katrina, when she read that a Louisiana church was asking for baby clothes for homeless families camped out on the church’s front lawn.“At once I knew I’d found a way to help”, Klein says. She pulled together all the boxedup outfits that her daughter, then one, had outgrown, and spread the word to a few friends. Within days, 200 pounds of onesies（连体衣）, booties, caps, sweaters, and other little items were piled up on her porch, ready to be shipped to New Orleans. Klein thought:“If that’s what I can do in four days with a few friends, what if I really put my mind to it?”Not long after her second child was born, in 2007, Klein started the nonprofit group Loved Twice to collect donations of gently used baby clothes for distribution to hospitals, prenatalcare clinics, and shelters in the San Francisco Bay Area.“You’re going through so much when you have a child. But these women also have to worry about having the money to feed the baby, buy diapers, and pay rent. We try to reduce some of that stress, hoping it will give the mothers more time to take care of their babies.”Now Loved Twice supplies baby clothes to 40 social service agencies assisting new mothers. Fifty more want to sign up. The group’s six collection bins fill up quickly, landing nearly 1,000 pounds of clothing in Klein’s basement every month.“My husband has been very supportive!”she says with a laugh.Volunteers sort the garments into boxes, each of which holds 75 items of clothing, sizes zero to 12 months, along with kid’s books and tips on childcare resources. To date, Klein’s group has sorted and sent over 28,000 pounds of clothing to newborns in needand the clothes keep on coming, she says.

9191_1,"阅读题Lisa Klein spends much of her time sorting out mountains of brightly colored baby clothes, folding tiny Tshirts. For most parents, this is pretty ordinary, but Klein has a larger purpose: She’s getting infant clothing to mothers in need.She was inspired a few days after Hurricane（飓风） Katrina, when she read that a Louisiana church was asking for baby clothes for homeless families camped out on the church’s front lawn.“At once I knew I’d found a way to help”, Klein says. She pulled together all the boxedup outfits that her daughter, then one, had outgrown, and spread the word to a few friends. Within days, 200 pounds of onesies（连体衣）, booties, caps, sweaters, and other little items were piled up on her porch, ready to be shipped to New Orleans. Klein thought:“If that’s what I can do in four days with a few friends, what if I really put my mind to it?”Not long after her second child was born, in 2007, Klein started the nonprofit group Loved Twice to collect donations of gently used baby clothes for distribution to hospitals, prenatalcare clinics, and shelters in the San Francisco Bay Area.“You’re going through so much when you have a child. But these women also have to worry about having the money to feed the baby, buy diapers, and pay rent. We try to reduce some of that stress, hoping it will give the mothers more time to take care of their babies.”Now Loved Twice supplies baby clothes to 40 social service agencies assisting new mothers.

In my opinion, it’s very likely for her to ask for help and support from the government so that she can have a warehouse to deal with more clothes and volunteers."

Even the most openminded and travelled individualsare not immuneto culture shock.PhasesCulture shock hasfour phasesThe Honeymoon Phase: This is a fun time. Everything is great, exciting, and new. You love the differences, meeting new people, tasting new foods, seeing different architecture, doing new things, working in your new job. This phase can last days, weeks, or months.The Honeymoon is Over Phase: During this phase, you're noticing differences, even slight differences, and typically not in a good way.

However, their remote locations mean that the French law is often ignored or unknown, thus making them into an interesting area of “lawlessness” in the world. The lives of these people have finally been recorded thanks to the effects of a Frenchman from Paris called Gin. Gin spent five months in early 2015 exploring the most remote corners of this area, which sits on the edge of the Amazon rainforest, with half its population of only 250,000 living in its capital, Cayenne. “I have a special love for the French Guianese people. I have worked there on and off for almost ten years,” says Gin. “I've been able to keep firm friendships with them. Thus I have been allowed to gain access to their living environment. I don't see it as a lawless land. But rather I see it as an area of freedom.” “I wanted to show the audience a photographic record touching upon the uncivilized(未开化的)life,” continues Gin. “I prefer to work in black and white, which allows me to show different specific worlds more clearly.” His blackandwhite pictures present a world almost lost in time.

All of that heat comes from the energy of the sun reacting with the pavement. But what if we could turn that energy into electricity? It may sound like a crazy science dream, but an electrical engineer and his wife may have found a way to do just that.Scott Brusaw has developed a sixsided glass panel (面板) that contains solar cells, which can change sunlight into electricity. The panels fit together and can form a flat surface on the ground. Brusaw and his wife, Julie, founded a company called Solar Roadways to further develop the idea and produce these new solar panels. They plan to use their invention to replace the pavement onU.S.roads.According to the Brusaws, if we replaced all of the nation's asphalt (沥青) with these solar panels, the network would produce more than three times the amount of electricity currently used by the United States in a year. In return, electricity from solar panels doesn't produce harmful pollution, so the panels could be a smart choice for the environment.TheU.S.government sees some promise in the Solar Roadways project. A number of laboratories around the country have tested the panels to see if they can withstand (经受) the heavy traffic and rough weather that asphalt pavement suffers from year to year. The lab results show that not only do the panels meet the requirements, but they can actually handle more weight than they need to.Now, money must be raised to start building the panel pavement system. The Brusaws have raised more than $1 million from ordinary people who learned abouttheir project. However, some experts predict the Brusaws' plan could finally cost more than $1 trillion.Could Solar Roadways be the answer to the world's evergrowing need for electricity? A lot of obstacles (阻碍) stand in the way of recreating the highway system out of solar panels.

Have you ever wondered why?Locusts(蝗虫) are super delicious food for birds, but it is not always an easy job for birds to catch them. It is neither because locusts are good jumpers or runners nor because they are smarter than their enemies(敌人). The reason is that the colours of locusts change with the colours of crops(庄稼). When crops are young, locusts look green. But when autumn comes, locusts change to the yellow and brown colour as crops do.Brown bears, tigers and other animals move quietly through forests. Their enemies can´t see them easily. This is because they have colours similar(相似)to the trees. For the same reason, polar bears that live on a land of snow and ice are white. Butterflies and bees living among the flowers are colourful like flowers. Soil insects are mostly darkcoloured and they live under the soil(土壤) in a dark and wet environment. However, insects with colours different from plants can easily be found and eaten by others. So in order to survive(幸存), they have to hide themselves in the daytime and appear only at night.Have you ever noticed some even stranger acts? The link fish in the sea can send out some very black ink when it faces danger. As the ink spreads over, its enemies will find themselves suddenly in a dark world. At the same time the ink fish immediately swims away. That is how it keeps itself safe though it is not strong at all###It is not easy for birds to catch locusts because###A、locusts are good runnerB、locusts can jump very highC、locusts are smarter than birdsD、locusts can change their color "

Have you ever wondered why?Locusts(蝗虫) are super delicious food for birds, but it is not always an easy job for birds to catch them.

9238_0,"The Sun: The Ultimate Power SourceEvery morning the sun rises, bringing light and heat to the earth, and every evening it sets. It seems so common that we rarely spare a thought for that bright object in the sky. Yet without it, we wouldn't exist!Deep in the core of our local star, hydrogen atoms (氢原子) react by nuclear fusion, producing a massive amount of energy that streams in all directions at the speed of light. In just eight minutes, that energy travels 93 million miles to earth.We use many different forms of energy here on earth, but here's the thing: almost all of them originate with the sun, not just light and heat energy! The law of conservation of energy says that energy can't be created or destroyed, but can change its form. And that's what happens with energy from the sun it changes into lots of different forms:Plants transform light energy from the sun into chemical energy (food) by the process of photosynthesis. Animals eat plants and use that same chemical energy for all their activities.Heat energy from the sun causes changing weather patterns that produce wind. Wind turbines then convert wind power into electrical energy.The sun sends more energy to the earth in one hour than the whole planet needs in a year. Imagine if we could capture that energy directly and convert it to a form that could power our cities, homes, and cars! Many scientists around the world are researching how we can improve our use of the sun's energy. One way is to use solar thermal panels to collect thermal energy to heat air and water. Another way is to use photovoltaic (PV) cells, also called solar cells, to convert sunlight directly into electricity. ('Photovoltaic' essentially means 'light electricity'.)PV cells today are still only able to capture a small part of the sun's energy, so acres of them are necessary to collect enough light to create electricity on a large scale. A lot more scientific work needs to be done to make them more efficient and take up less space. Despite the challenges, solar panels are used to power many things such as emergency signs, school crossing lights, and more. Many people are also able to power their homes by setting up solar panels on the roof, and this will only get easier as the technology continues to advance###What do we know about the energy produced in the sun###A、It can travel at the speed of light in one direction.B、It is produced through a kind of nuclear reaction.C、It is produced by hydrogen atoms fusion.D、It can be sent to the earth in 8 seconds.

In the early 1990s, researchers from France and the US published articles that said listening to Mozart for 10 minutes temporarily（临时地） improved performance on IQ tests and challenging tasks. As a result, the media quickly began reporting on the “Mozart effect.”In 1997, Don Campbell created the term and published a book about this interesting phenomenon（现象）. Campbell claimed that classical music could improve health and memory, decrease mental and physical disorders, and reduce stress and depression. He soon followed with The Mozart Effect for Children, as well as CDs and products for parents of young children. Today, a wide selection of similar products is available, including Baby Mozart and Baby Bach, two bestselling DVDs in the popular Baby Einstein series. There are even music players specially designed for expectant mothers to wear on their stomachs. This way, babies can listen to classical music before they´re even born.However, there is some doubt surrounding the Mozart effect. Parents question whether it is a proven reality or just a fashion designed to make money. Frances H. Rauscher, a psychologist and author of one of the original studies, isdoubting. Much of the original research pointed to temporary improvements on specific tasks. She believes these findings have been incorrectly described as a general increase in intelligence. “I don't think it can hurt,” Rauscher said. Yet she added that parents may still want to think twice before spending a fortune trying to make a genius out of their baby###According to thepassage, what is meant by the Mozart effect###A、Special DVDs can help teach a child to play musical instruments.B、Researchers can determine a child’s intelligence by studying musical ability.C、Singing to an unborn child may inspire a love of classical music.D、Listening to classical music may increase intelligence, especially in babies.

Now she is about to begin her freshman year at the University of California, planning to become a professor.Born and raised in San Diego's City Heights neighbourhood, Deka is the daughter of a Somali refugee couple. While some might say Deka's success happened in spite of her background, she would say differently, that her experiences shaped her and inspired her to be the driven, young scientist that she is today.When Deka was eight years old, her mother got a job by studying hard back in school in order to support the whole family.

She spent a lot of time in the library reading books, and didn't do many of the things her peers did, like partying or having romantic relationships.“I always felt like I had to be the perfect girl for my family,” Deka said. “You have to not even do your best but two times better than everyone else. I felt like the whole world was waiting for me to mess up.”Deka's efforts paid off. The summer before her senior year of high school, she was accepted to the American Chemical Society Project SEED Programme. “She brought both enthusiasm and focus,” Botham, a researcher at this research institute, recalled. “She arrived every day ready to work, ready to learn and ready to tackle new challenges regardless of whether or not she had done anything similar.”When asked what advice she would give to others like her, Deka warned them not to underestimate themselves. “Don't tell yourself that scholarship is too big or this programme is too competitive or I'll never get into this school, ” she said. “I was not sure whether I could make it until I started seeing the acceptance letters rolling in.”###{34}From the passage, we can learn that ###A、Deka was adopted by a refugee familyB、Deka spent a lot of time going to partiesC、Deka became a professor after graduationD、Deka's experiences drove her to work hard "

9254_0,"A few years ago, I lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge. I bicycled every day to work. To find my way, I used my phone, which sent me the shortest route. But after a month of cycling every day on the carpacked streets, I took a different route one day. I'm not entirely sure why I took a different route that day. I just remember a feeling of surprise; surprise at finding a street with no cars; surprise at finding a street decorated by fallen leaves and surrounded by trees. But after the feeling of surprise, I felt . How could I have been so blind? For an entire month, I was so trapped in my mobile app that a journey to work became one thing only: the shortest path. In this single journey, there was no thought of enjoying the road, no pleasure inconnecting with nature, no possibility of looking people in the eyes. And why? Because I was saving a minute out of my commute (通勤).As an engineer, I focused on efficiency for many years. But after that experience, I changed. I changed my research from traditional datamining to understanding how people experience the city. The result of that research has been the creation of new maps, maps where you don't only find the shortest path, but also the most enjoyable path.Einstein once said, “Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.” So with a bit of imagination, we needed to understand which parts of the city people find beautiful. At the University of Cambridge, with colleagues, we thought about this simple experiment. We built a crowdsourcing platform, a web game. Players are shown pairs of urban scenes, and they're asked to choose which one is more beautiful, quiet and happy. Based on thousands of user votes, then we are able to see where consensus emerges. We are able to see what urban scenes make people happy.After that work, I joined Yahoo Labs to build a new map of the city, a map based on human emotions. On this map, you're not only able to see the shortest route, but you're also able to see the beautiful path, the quiet path. In tests, participants found the happy, the beautiful, the quiet path far more enjoyable than the shortest one, and that was achieved just by adding a few minutes to travel time.What my research tries to do is avoid the danger of the single path, to avoid robbing people of fully experiencing the city in which they live. Walk the path through the park, not through the car park, and you have an entirely different path. Walk the path full of people you love and not full of cars, and you have an entirely different path.

Italso cares about how people feel. It offers not only the shortest route, but also an enjoyable route which allows them to enjoy the beauty along the way.  I support the idea of a map based on human emotions, we should be given more options in life and learn to enjoy the process, instead of focusing too much on the result. Even if we are busy in today's fast-paced world, a map based on human emotions will remind us to slow down a bit, and enjoy life.Possible answer2:According to the passage, “a map based on human emotions”means that the map does not only concern direction and efficiency. It also cares about how people feel. It offers not only the shortest route, but also an enjoyable route which allows them to enjoy the beauty along the way.The idea sounds great, but I don't think it necessary to create such a map, as maps should be a tool to offer guidance and improve our efficiency. If I want to explore a city, I will either consult a tourist guidebook, or take on my own adventure and experience it myself, instead of relying on information provided by a map."

When the animals attacked（攻击) her, she fought them with a stick.Rescue(营救) planes were looking for people who were still alive after the accident, but after ten days, they decided to give up.

Let's forget for the moment the “classic” argument: it is a classic piece of American literature that touches on timeless themes. Instead, let's look at the novel: The story follows the adventures of a poor, uneducated white boy who is accompanied by a slave through the South. While not strictly a history of the times, it does focus on racism, prejudice, slavery and addiction among other themes. It does this through humor and satire and insight into the human condition.One of the most telling episodes in the novel is the feud(不和) between the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons. In a sense, the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons stand for the prejudice between blacks and whites. But Huck doesn't see the connection; his journey for freedom is really Jim's journey for freedom, because all of the adventures together help him realize that Jim is a human being who deserves his own freedom, despite the color of his skin and the “way it's always been done” that Huck's been taught.The word “negro” can be seen everywhere in the work, deliberately making people during Mark Twain's time uncomfortable, but seriously making people of our time question whether the book should even be taught today. Several editors have tried to lessen its impact or removed it altogether. But that word is a barometer of our times it's a word that marks this as a different time, when it's used in a different way, in a different context as if to wash the word of its past and give it a different direction. But it is a word that deserves to be discussed along with other words that mark our prejudices and our fears.Why read Huck Finn? At the beginning of the novel, Huck can't possibly understand Jim's pain at being separated from his family and in the end, he can't possibly see Jim being allowed to remain a slave to anyone. The novel has some genuinely funny and frightening moments, some insights, some questions, some flaws, but at the heart is a boy who learns a great deal about the world around him, who takes us on an adventure into what is in our own hearts###The writer thinks that ###A、everyone should read classicsB、all classics are worth readingC、the novel has its own valueD、the argument can be helpful  "

Many people think it's because they don't want adults to understand, but that probably isn't truethe real reason is that teenagers like to be creative and play with language, so they have fun creating new words.And what do parents and old people think about it all?

Please use evidence to support your opinion###Possible answers: I think it’s quite okay for teenagers to create their own words. They like to be creative and play with language, and they do what makes them happy.Or: I don’t think they should create their own words, because that will cause confusion and misunderstanding when they communicate with adults or teenagers from other groups."

During his early years in Oklahoma, Woody experienced a series of tragic personal losses: the accidental death of his older sister Clara, the family's financial ruin, and the eventual loss of his motherwho died of Huntington's Disease. He spent most of his early years struggling to support his family, and he traveled several places for that purpose.Woody left for New York in 1940. There he met Alan Lomax, an expert on America's traditional music. He collected and recorded traditional American folk music, which had few fans at that time. When he heard Woody sing, Lomax knew he had found a true singer of American folk music.Lomax recorded many of Woody's songs for the Library of Congress. Woody proved himself a hardhitting advocate for truth, fairness, and justice. Woody strongly identified with his audience and adapted to an “outsider” status, along with them. This role would become an essential element of his political and social positioning, gradually working its way into his songwriting; “I Ain't Got No Home”, “Goin' Down the Road Feelin' Bad”, “Talking Dust Bowl Blues”; all reflect his desire to give voice to those who had been underpowered.About twenty years later, the disease that took away his mother's life also began to attack the son. Woody's health got worse and worse, and finally he entered a hospital.  While Woody seemed to be forgotten, his music was not. By the late 1950s, folk music became popular in America.

Among them was Bob Dylan, one of America's greatest popular songwriters. He called Woody his hero. Dylan and others copied the way Woody sang and played the guitar.

It represents an advanced understanding of weight and load characteristics, showing the wisdom of Italians.Originally designed to be a bell tower, the Leaning Tower of Pisa was built in 1173 and stopped in 1185 because Pisa had gone to war with Florence. During the year of war, the tower began to lean because of loose soil and a badly laid foundation and construction did not begin again until 1272, almost a hundred years later, and by which time the foundation had settled. An architect named Giovanni di Simone built the walls on one side taller than the other in order to try to correct the tilt(倾斜).

There isn’t a musical instrument made by man that can produce a more beautiful sound than the song of the mockingbird.I decided that I would catch a young bird and keep it in a cage and that way have my own private musician.I finally succeeded in catching one and put it in a cage.

The baby bird ate everything she brought to it. I was pleased to see this.

Share your story and feelings###The first time I encountered music was even before I was born. My mother used to listen to music all the time at home and I was born with music.

As for you, I suggest you try the Chinese flute for I know that you can play saxophone. They both require a good lung capacity.

If they fail a swimming test at the beginning of their university course, they won´t receive their degree until they can pass the test successfully, according to an announcement by Tsinghua University president Qiu Yong.Exceptions will be allowed for students with certain physical or mental conditions, if proven by medical staff.Liu Bo, head of the Division of Sports Science and Physical Education, explained why the university is linking swimming ability with degrees.“As a requisite survival skill, swimming is beneficial for students in a long run, for swimming is helpful in improving students´endurance and does less harm to joints and muscles as a water sport,” he told China Daily.Viewing the ability to swim as a must for student is not something new to this university it was also a requirement in the early 20thcentury. It was later dropped due to a rising number of students and a lack of facilities. Besides Tsinghua University, Peking University and Xiamen University have also listed swimming as a compulsory course for students.However, the announcement has caused a heated debate.Some welcomed the new rules, saying it’s a necessary skill that can save lives.

I believe making it mandatory is necessary,” Yuan Jiaxiang, a junior in Tsinghua´s Department of Civil Engineering, told China Daily.However, some said it has noting to do with getting a degree.“It´s not reasonable to require people to be able to swim for them to graduate,” Heng Xiaoyu, a high school student from the Middle School Affiliate to Northern Jiaotong University, told China Daily. “For a lot of people who grow up in inland cities, learning how to swim as an adult will be difficult”In fact, Chinese Universities are not the only education organizations that encourage their students to swim.

9296_4,"The need to feed a growing population is putting much pressure on the world's supply of water. With 97% of the world's water too salty to be drunk or used in agriculture, the worldwide supply of water needs careful management, especially in agriculture. Although the idea of a water shortageseems strange to someone fortunate enough to live in a high rainfall country, many of the world's agricultural industries experience constant water shortages.Although dams can be built to store water for agricultural use in dry areas and dry seasons, the costs of water redistribution(重新分配)are very high. Not only is there the cost of the engineering itself, but there is also an environmental cost to be considered. Where valleys(山谷)are flooded to create dams, houses are lost and wildlife homes destroyed. Besides, water may flow easily through pipes to fields, but it cannot be transported from one side of the world to the other. Each country must therefore rely on the management of its own water to supply its farming requirements.This is particularly troubling for countries with agricultural industries in areas dependent on irrigation (灌溉). In Texas, farmers' overuse of irrigation water has resulted in a 25% reduction of the water stores. In the Central Valley area of southwestern USA, a huge water engineering project provided water for farming in dry valleys, but much of the water use has been poorly managed.Saudi Arabia's attempts to grow wheat in desert areas have seen the pumping of huge quantities of irrigation water from underground reserves. Because there is no rainfall in these areas, such reserves can only decrease, and it is believed that fifty years of pumping will see them run dry###What is most likely to be discussed in the paragraph that follows?Why###I think in the following paragraph, the author will talk about the measures to deal with worldwide water shortages.The author raises the question of water shortage at the beginning of the passage. Then the author analyzes the problems in detail. Since there is a problem, there are possible solutions. Following the problem-solution pattern, I think the author will give his/her opinion on how todeal with worldwide water shortages."

The relationship between the two artists is very special. They overcame the differences between age and nationality, and became teacher and student and even formed a friendship. Moreover, the relation happened right before the war between China and Japan. Therefore, this exhibition is valuable in art history."

The major difference is that in origami, you fold paper whereas in kirigami, you fold and cut paper.In the United States, the term “kirigami” was coined by Florence Temko. She used the word kirigami in the title of her book, “Kirigami, the Creative Art of Papercutting”. The book was so successful that the word kirigami was accepted as the name for the art of paper cutting. In Japan, the word kirigami had been in use for a long time because “kiru” means to cut, and “gami” means paper. Therefore, kirigami meant to cut paper.Kirigami Paper SnowflakesMost people will remember kirigami as a way to make paper snowflakes.

The major difference is that in origami, you fold paper whereas in kirigami, you fold and cut paper.In the United States, the term “kirigami” was coined by Florence Temko. She used the word kirigami in the title of her book, “Kirigami, the Creative Art of Papercutting”. The book was so successful that the word kirigami was accepted as the name for the art of paper cutting. In Japan, the word kirigami had been in use for a long time because “kiru” means to cut, and “gami” means paper. Therefore, kirigami meant to cut paper.Kirigami Paper SnowflakesMost people will remember kirigami as a way to make paper snowflakes. Unfolding the paper snowflake is a delightful surprise because it's almost impossible to make the exact pattern twice. Paper snowflakes have six sections because the paper is folded in half and then thirds.Real snowflakes have sixfold symmetry, too. No two snowflakes are alike because the condition in a cloud is always changing when water vapour crystallizes into snowflakes. Because of these ever changing atmospheric conditions, each snowflake grows in a different way.Problem: it's spring and it just doesn't feel right to make snowflakes in the glorious growing season. Not a problem! Cut kirigami flowers, sunbursts, stars, hearts, and other cool designs.Beyond Simple Kirigami SnowflakesSome artists can make extremely elaborate kirigami patterns. These often retain a high level of symmetry and have a delicate lacelike quality. With a practice, you can make similar creations.Cutting paper snowflakes is fun, but if you don't want to use scissors, you don't have to. Computer software experts have now made it possible to make esnowflakes. It's not the same as good old “arts & crafts”, but it's worth a try nevertheless###What are the similarities between kirigami snowflakes and real snowflakes###Because the author thinkspaper snowflakes and real snowflakes are similar in two ways. First of all, they both have six-fold symmetry.Secondly,no two snowflakes are alike. Because of the ever changing atmospheric conditions, each real snowflake grows in a different way. And while people are cutting paper, it is almost impossible to make the exact pattern twice."

But in my opinion, they cannot be called “art”, because art cannot be mass produced. People can try electronic versions of traditional art form for the purpose of recreation, but real artwork should only be done traditionally. For example, when paintings are drawn through computer software, they may look more colorful or attractive than real oil paintings, but we cannot feel the brush stroke or the strength in traditional paintings. It is the same with e-snowflakes. We can probably make a hundred e-snowflakes in several minutes, looking all the same, but we cannot feel the caution and concern we put in the real paper cut while the scissors are running through our fingers."

The Sun is the major source of energy for our planet. It causes the evaporation (蒸发) of water from the oceans and lakes. Sunlight also provides the energy used by green plants to make their own food. These green plants then provide food for all organisms(生物) on the Earth.Much of the energy that comes from the Sun never reaches the Earth's surface. It is either reflected or absorbed by the gases in the upper atmosphere. Of the energy that reaches the lower atmosphere, 30% is reflected by clouds or the Earth's surface. The remaining 70% warms the surface of the planet, causes water to evaporate, and provides energy for the water cycle and weather. Only a tiny part, approximately 0.023%, is actually used by green plants to produce food.Many gases found in the atmosphere actually reflect heat energy escaping from the Earth's surface back to the Earth. These gases act like the glass of a greenhouse in that they allow energy from the Sun to enter but prevent energy from leaving. They are therefore called greenhouse gases.When sunlight strikes an object, some of the energy is absorbed and some is reflected. The amount reflected depends on the surface. For example, you've probably noticed how bright snow is when sunlight falls on it. Snow reflects most of the energy from the Sun, so it contributes to the low temperatures of winter.

Firstly, the Sun is the major source of energy for our planet. Sunlight provides energy to green plants which then provide food for all organisms(生物) on the Earth. Secondly, the sun provides us with light and warmth. When sunlight strikes an object, some of the energy is absorbed, which can help warm the surrounding air; while some is reflected, which can make the object look bright.

9321_0,".阅读下面短文根据短文意思选择最佳答案Jane Goodall is one of the most wellknown scientists in the world. Much of the information we have today about chimpanzees comes from the research of Jane Goodall.Jane Goodall was born in London in 1934. She became interested in animals and animal stories when she was a very young child. She always dreamed of working with wild animals. When she was eleven years old, she decided that she wanted to go to Africa to live with and write about animals. But this was not the kind of thing young women usually did in the 1940s. Everybody was laughing except her mother. “If you really want something, you work hard, you take advantage of opportunity, you never give up, you find a way,” her mother said to her. The opportunity came at last. A school friend invited her to Africa. Jane worked as a waitress until she had got enough money to travel there.In 1957, Jane Goodall traveled to Africa. She soon met the wellknown scientist Louis Leakey and began working for him as an assistant. He later asked her to study a group of chimpanzees living by a lake in Tanzania. Very little was known about wild chimpanzees at that time.Jane spent many years studying chimpanzees in this area of Africa. It was not easy work. They were very shy and would run away whenever she came near. She learned to watch them from far away using binoculars. Over time, she slowly gained their trust. She gave the chimpanzees human names such as David Graybeard, Flo and Fifi. Watching the chimpanzees, she made many discoveries. They ate vegetables and fruits. But she found that they also eat meat. A few weeks later, she made an even more surprising discovery. She saw chimpanzees making and using tools to help them catch insects.Jane Goodall has written many books for adults and children about wild chimpanzees. Her most recent book is calledHope for Animals and Their World. It tells about saving several kinds of endangered animals###What is Jane Goodall famous for###Possible answer: Studying chimpanzees."

9325_0,"阅读下面短文根据短文意思选择最佳答案Do you want to become better at making small talk with new people? Do you want to become better at networking with others? Nothing will improve your networking ability and your ability to make a successful conversation with other people rather than your curiosity(好奇心) about them.When you are curious about other people, you will want to discover some of the interesting ways that they are similar to you. When you are curious about them, you’ll also be interested to discover the ways in which they think differently and live differently from you.When you have curiosity about others, you will be much lessselfconsciousand your conversations will work a lot better. Instead of worrying yourself, “What can I say next that won’t sound stupid?” you will be focused on learning more about the other person.Making small talk with strangers can be tricky. We’ve all heard the advice that we should pick something out of our immediate environment and use that as a main point to start our small talk with the other person.It’s true that this can be a great starting point for a conversation. However, when you focus too much on discussing things like the weather in your city, you can bring the conversation to a painful end very quickly. The other person will sense that you are trying to make a conversation, but that you have no interest in really getting to know him or her.How can you keep small talk from becoming boring?One way is to watch the other person for clues they will give you about what is really interesting to them. When you get these clues, use them to start making the conversation a bit more about their life, their opinions, and their experiences.After you have had a couple of minutes to break the ice, try looking for ways to make the conversation a little bit more personal. Ask the other person for his or her opinion about something that is a bit more personal but not extremely so. The first few minutes of talking to someone new will not be the best time to ask the other person his or her opinion on religious（宗教的）or political（政治的）matters.

9325_1,"阅读下面短文根据短文意思选择最佳答案Do you want to become better at making small talk with new people? Do you want to become better at networking with others? Nothing will improve your networking ability and your ability to make a successful conversation with other people rather than your curiosity(好奇心) about them.When you are curious about other people, you will want to discover some of the interesting ways that they are similar to you. When you are curious about them, you’ll also be interested to discover the ways in which they think differently and live differently from you.When you have curiosity about others, you will be much lessselfconsciousand your conversations will work a lot better. Instead of worrying yourself, “What can I say next that won’t sound stupid?” you will be focused on learning more about the other person.Making small talk with strangers can be tricky. We’ve all heard the advice that we should pick something out of our immediate environment and use that as a main point to start our small talk with the other person.It’s true that this can be a great starting point for a conversation. However, when you focus too much on discussing things like the weather in your city, you can bring the conversation to a painful end very quickly. The other person will sense that you are trying to make a conversation, but that you have no interest in really getting to know him or her.How can you keep small talk from becoming boring?One way is to watch the other person for clues they will give you about what is really interesting to them. When you get these clues, use them to start making the conversation a bit more about their life, their opinions, and their experiences.After you have had a couple of minutes to break the ice, try looking for ways to make the conversation a little bit more personal.

9340_0,"阅读题Hearing about a parttime job working on an archaeological(考古的)dig in Kiyotake, Japan from myfriend, I was really worried if I had the skills to do what that kind of work demanded: precise technique, concentration, and patience. However, I was anxious to work there because I had been taking an anthropology(人类学) class at my college.I was fascinated by the idea of excavating(挖掘) underground and inferring human behavior from artifacts, which is the most interesting and fantastic part of the job for archaeologists. I began to work at the archaeological site in Kiyotake around the beginning of January, 1996. Honestly speaking, I had expected that I would do something like real archaeologists do before I went there; however, I was just digging in the ground and carrying lots and lots of soil for the first month.I still can´t forget the great moment when I found a piece of ancient pottery for the first time. It was beyond description. I waswiped outall the time after a day of work; however, the work was fun for me even though I sometimes injured my eyes because of the dust or acid sand blown by strong winds.After some time had passed and we had excavated to a certain depth, my supervisor asked me to help him draw the old site. I had to record what kinds of objects we found and the height of their existence on a sheet of paper.From February on, my friends and I had to carefully get rid of dust or sand on the many artifacts which we had found. We were not allowed to brush them as we had to make sure not to injure their surfaces. I guess we had designs on the pottery which could not be seen because of the dust and sand on the artifacts.During my archaeological work, I sometimes had muscle problems in my shoulders and legs; however, it was a delight to feel what archaeology was by doing the work with my own hands.

More recently the book has been attacked because of the character Jim, theescaped slave, and many occurrences of the word nigger.But the attacks were and are sillyand miss the point. The novel is strongly antislavery. Jim'ssearch through the slave states for the family from whom he has been forcibly parted is heroic. AsJ.

H. B. Stowe'sUncle Tom's Cabinis only the most famous example.These early stories dealt directly with slavery.

And Twain, raised in a slave state,briefly a soldier, and inventor of Jim, may have done more to anger the nation over racial injusticeand awaken its collective conscience than any other novelist in the past century###Why does the author mentionLincoln?Is Mark Twain a racist? Summarize the author's points of view in your own words. If you could add more ideas, that would be even better###If you ask the question of whether Mark Twain is a racist, it is likeasking the same ofLincoln, who is widely known for his anti-slavery. Lincoln, who believed the black manthe inferior of the white, fought and won a war to free him.Actually Mark Twain isthe man who popularized the clever literary attack on racism.And Twain, raised in a slave state,briefly a soldier, and inventor of Jim, may have done more to anger the nation over racial injusticeand awaken its collective conscience than any other novelist in the past century.Twain's mystery novelPudd'nhead Wilsonis also another example whichstood as a challenge to theracial beliefs of even many of the liberals of his day.It shows the point of view thatnurture, not nature, was the key to social status. So I don't think Mark Twain is a racist."

9352_0,"阅读下面短文根据短文意思选择最佳答案According to a new scientific research, we are rapidly going close to major climate change and the effects on the environment could be quite serious. Geographers predict that climate zones could completely disappear within the next eighty years. Where will crops be grown if this happens? When the climate changes a lot, polar regions will get colder andtropicalregions will get even hotter. As a result, where will animals be forced to move on the earth? Climate changes like these could lead to the spread of diseases. Tropical storms and hurricanes(飓风) will not only increase but may also become stronger. If the changes come too quickly, animals and plants may not be able to adapt(适应) right away and could disappear from the earth.According to Science Daily, a new study predicts that, by the year 2100, many of today´s familiar climates will be taken place by climate unknown in today´s world. It is urgent that we reduce the risks of farreaching results for the whole world. The planet itself has been showing signs of change. In 2004, a huge tsunami created by a major earthquake killed thousands in Sumatra and in 2008, thousands more died in China in another big earthquake. Egypt was hit in 2009 with a major earthquake and Haiti was destroyed seriously and became ruins in 2010 by another big earthquake.Not long ago, scientists discovered ice melting(融化) in west Antarctica(南极洲). This is very worrying because temperatures in this area have remained rather constant(不断的) and actually even lower at time. Melting occurs when temperatures increase and since temperatures have remained, the ice should not be melting. However, satellite data(数据) shows melting around west Antarctica.Within just the last few months, new reports from around the world have been coming in and most agree that our climate situation is much worse than previously expected. At this point, it doesn´t matter what is causing it, but rather, what can be done about it. On the other hand, our world is getting more and more unstable(不稳定) every year. Natural disasters(灾难) are becoming more frequent(频繁的) and serious.However, other planets are experiencing global warming as well as our own and some scientists believe there may be some connections between these. No one knows anything for sure at this point because there is simply not enough data###What´s the writer´s attitude toward the climate changes###A、We should observe the great changes of the climate carefully.B、We must connect with other planets to prevent the climate changes.C、We should try our best to do something against the climate changes.D、We need to discover what causes the climate changes first of all.

9354_0,"阅读下面短文根据短文意思选择最佳答案I am an eighthgrade student at Central Middle School. In my three years at the school, I have played soccer, basketball, and baseball. I love sports and really enjoy being part of a team. Playing on our school sports teams has been the best part of middle school for me. I know I´m lucky that I´ve had this opportunity.Some kids have not been so lucky. In fact, many kids who love sports don´t have the chance to play on a school team. That´s because, to make a team, you have to try out. The idea is that kids who are good at sports will do well in tryouts and make the team. But what about the kids who don´t do well during tryouts? Maybe they are ill that day, or nervous, or are just having a bad day, so they don´t play their best. They don´t make the team, and that is too bad.Also, there are kids who really don’t have the skills to play well. They never make a team, and that isn´t fair either. How will kids ever learn the skills if they don´t have a chance to play? Remember, this is the school and students are here to learn. All kids should have the chance to learn sports skills and teamwork by playing on a school sports team.There are other reasons why every student should have the chance to play sports. Sports are important for good health and fitness. They help kids feel good about themselves and their school. They build friendships among teammates. Coaches are good role models, and students who play team sports learn good sportsmanship. And, most important, team sports are fun!

This is part of what she talked to the students last week.“When we cut ourselves we usually bleed. This is because our bodies are full of blood vessels, which carry blood to and from the heart. It doesn´t matter if we lose a little blood from time to time. In fact, many people donate blood without harming ourselves. We mustn´t lose too much blood, however, so we need to know how to stop bleeding when it occurs.”“If the injury is small and amount of blood coming from it is also small, we can usually stop the blood from flowing by pressing on the cut with a clean, cold, wet cloth that has a little antiseptic on it. It is most important to use antiseptic. If you do not, then any dirt or bacteria that get into the wound may cause an infection.“If the injury is large and the amount of blood coming from it is also large, then it is necessary to stop the blood flowing through the blood vessel. We do this by putting pressure on the vessel above the injury. We can either press on it with our fingers or, preferably put on a tourniquet, which can be tied tightly around the arm, leg or finger.”###What did Jane talk to the students about last week###A、Preventing accidents.B、Stopping bleeding.C、How to help others.D、How to put a bandage on.

9376_0,"阅读题Phil White has just returned from an 18,000mile, aroundtheworld bicycle trip. White had two reasons for making this long and difficult journey. First of all, he wanted to use the trip to raise money for charity（慈善机构）, which he did. He raised￡70,000 for the British charity, Oxfam. White's second reason for making the trip was to break the world record and become the fastest person to cycle around the world. He is still waiting to find out if he has broken the record or not.White set off from Trafalgar Square, in London, on 19th June, 2004 and was back 299 days later. He spent more than l,300 hours in the saddle（车座） and destroyed four sets of tyres and three bike chains. He had the adventure（冒险经历）of his life crossing Europe, the Middle East, India, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the Americas. Amazingly, he did all of this with absolutely no support team. No jeep carrying food, water and medicine. No doctor. Nothing! Just a bike and a very, very long road.The journey was lonely and desperate（绝望）at times. He also had to fight his way across deserts, through jungles and over mountains. He cycled through heavy rains and temperatures of up to 45 degrees, all to help people in need. There were other dangers along the road. In Iran, he was chased by armed robbers and was lucky to escape with his life and the little money he had. The worst thing that happened to him was having to cycle into a headwind on a road that crosses the south of Australia. For 1,000 kilometers he battled against the wind that was constantly pushing him. This part of the trip was slow, hard work and depressing（令人沮丧的）, but he made it in the end. Now Mr. White is back and intends to write a book about his adventures###What does the passage mainly talk about###A、Travelling by bicycle.B、Phil White´s bicycle trip.C、Breaking the world record.D、Raising money for charity.

He also had to cycle through the extreme weather conditions such as heavy rains, high temperatures, a strong headwind etc. What´s more, he had to face the unexpected dangers like being chased by armed robbers.

9376_2,"阅读题Phil White has just returned from an 18,000mile, aroundtheworld bicycle trip. White had two reasons for making this long and difficult journey. First of all, he wanted to use the trip to raise money for charity（慈善机构）, which he did. He raised￡70,000 for the British charity, Oxfam. White's second reason for making the trip was to break the world record and become the fastest person to cycle around the world. He is still waiting to find out if he has broken the record or not.White set off from Trafalgar Square, in London, on 19th June, 2004 and was back 299 days later. He spent more than l,300 hours in the saddle（车座） and destroyed four sets of tyres and three bike chains. He had the adventure（冒险经历）of his life crossing Europe, the Middle East, India, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the Americas. Amazingly, he did all of this with absolutely no support team. No jeep carrying food, water and medicine. No doctor. Nothing! Just a bike and a very, very long road.The journey was lonely and desperate（绝望）at times. He also had to fight his way across deserts, through jungles and over mountains. He cycled through heavy rains and temperatures of up to 45 degrees, all to help people in need. There were other dangers along the road. In Iran, he was chased by armed robbers and was lucky to escape with his life and the little money he had. The worst thing that happened to him was having to cycle into a headwind on a road that crosses the south of Australia. For 1,000 kilometers he battled against the wind that was constantly pushing him. This part of the trip was slow, hard work and depressing（令人沮丧的）, but he made it in the end. Now Mr. White is back and intends to write a book about his adventures###What happened after Phil White came back from the bicycle trip? Please continue with the story###Ten months after he returned from his bicycle trip, Phil White published his book entitled “Phil´s Bicycle Tour around the World”. Through words and photographs, he shared his adventures with the world. He described vividly how he fought against loneliness, extreme weather and even armed robbers. His book was so popular that it went straight to number one on the best-seller list of that year. Again, he donated all the money to the British charity, Oxfam."

Nowadays many people dream to break the world record and they do strange things. For example, an American singerholds the world record for the longest fingernails, measuring 309.8cm on her left hand and 292.1cm on her right. In order to break the world record, somepeople will do anything. What´s your opinion of it###It´s not an easy task to break the world record, which needs great efforts and devotion. So in my opinion, people should do something meaningful, something that is highly beneficial to human and society. As for me, having the long nails only brings trouble. I can´t really see any beauty of these long fingernails. Of course everyone is free to do what he/she likes as long as it´s legal. But I won´t do such a thing and I don´t want to break such a world record."

In 1066 the Normans led by William defeated the Saxons and began their rule over England.

As a result, English words of politics and the law come from French rather than German.

Why do you think so###Some will say that invaders bring not only killing but also language, culture and customs. But isn’t it ridiculous? Language, culture and customs can be introduced to a country through other friendlier way, such as through education, through business, through traveling and so on. Our traditional culture spread all over the world, but not through invasion. Right?"
9392_4,"阅读题If you ask people to name the one person who had the greatest effect on the English language, you will get answers like “Shakespeare,” “Samuel Johnson,” and “Webster,” but none of these men had any effect at all compared to a man who didn´t even speak EnglishWilliam the Conqueror (征服者).Before 1066, in the land we now call Great Britain lived peoples belonging to two major language groups. In the westcentral region lived the Welsh, who spoke a Celtic language, and in the north lived the Scots, whose language, though not the same as Welsh, was also Celtic. In the rest of the country lived the Saxons, actually a mixture of Anglos, Saxons, and other Germanic and Nordic peoples, who spoke what we now call AngloSaxon or Old English, a Germanic language.

People could understand each other much better despite different cultures. The corporations would be more efficient. If the world was better able to understand each other then there would likely be a reduced amount of conflict. Nations around the world would be much closer. Wars would be possibly avoided. So I think it’s really cool if everyone on Earth spoke the same language."

Ereaders may help you say goodbye to your heavy schoolbag.An ereader has the memory space to hold hundreds of books. So people want to replace heavy schoolbags with small, light ereaders. For example, Cushing Academy, a high school in Massachusetts, US, got rid of most of the 20,000 books in its library last summer. The head of the library said that the school was going to replace printed books with ebooks. Teachers and students will use ereaders instead.Most ereaders are thin and weigh less than 500g. They can download an ebook in 60 seconds. “It’s so convenient. You can have so many books right at your fingertips!” said Meghan Chenausky, 16.Chinese schoolchildren are also trying ereaders. At the 2010 Shanghai Expo, an eschoolbag was on show. It is a special ereader that students can use to download textbooks from the school servers.

9443_0,"Read the passage and finish the following tasks.My favorite great book isThe Adventure of Tom Sawyerby Mark Twain. It is regarded as aliterary masterpiecein American literature.The story line is simple. The book is like a biography of a summer in Tom Sawyer's life.The main character,Tom,is an orphanandlives with his aunt Polly in a quiet street of St. Petersburg, Missouri. He's a lively and clever young boy,but doesn't like school, and always likes to escape the school to fish.He finds himself in many exciting adventures. He runs away with his two trusted friends, Huck Finn and Joe, to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days. With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave. Finally, they find a box of gold andbecome millionaires. Tom Sawyer and Finn have great adventures on the Mississippi River, pretending to be pirates, attending their own funeral, and witnessing a murder. Tom overcomes fear and appears in court and speaks out the murderer.My favorite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead. He decides to go to his own funeral. He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is surprised to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive.Tom is the hero of the story, but there are other important characters. Huck,who few of the adults approve of,is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him. Becky is pretty with fair hair, Joe is Tom's best friend and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story.The theme of the story is about children growing up. It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America.It is a story filled with action, adventure, ingenious ideas, love, and schoolyard politics.Finally, it talks about freedom, social rules and how people are punished for bad behavior.The whole story is seemingly a complication of what Twain did or wishes he did during his childhood.Why do I thinkThe Adventure of Tom Sawyeris a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876, but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story, Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in the 19th century, so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature. Go on read it! I know you'll enjoy it, too###Where does Tom run away with his two friends###To an island"

It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America.It is a story filled with action, adventure, ingenious ideas, love, and schoolyard politics.Finally, it talks about freedom, social rules and how people are punished for bad behavior.The whole story is seemingly a complication of what Twain did or wishes he did during his childhood.Why do I thinkThe Adventure of Tom Sawyeris a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876, but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story, Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in the 19th century, so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature. Go on read it! I know you'll enjoy it, too###Why does the author thinkThe Adventure of Tom Sawyeris a great book?

On the early morning on the last Wednesday of Augest, when my parents and I were walking along the street inthe Spanish town of Bunol, we saw several large trucks driving near. On the trucks were full of tomatoes, which were like red mountains. The crowds on both sides of the street cheered and shouted at the sight of the trucks. As the trucks pulled over to the side of the street, several people on the trucks began to throw tomatoes to the excited crowds! The food fight began and people got crazy! Laughing and screaming, people threwtomatoesto anyone nearby! In no time, everyone onthestreet was covered by tomato pieces and tomato juice! We could do nothing but join in the battle. Anyway, no one only wanted to be the target! I picked up the tomatoes on the ground and threw them to whomever I spotted.The battle lasts little more than half an hour. When it came to an end, everybody on the street, including my parents and me, was in a total mess! However, I felt so excited and joyful!

But too many activities are nothing but burdens to both parents and children. Life should becolorful. Life without necessary break will only bring us depression. On the other hand, activities after school are not guarantee to bright future. Healthy character is as important as knowledge."

This is why we should take part in too many activities. Otherwise, we will only feel tired, and our time will be wasted."

I agree with the experts’ opinion. Nowadays, many marathons are held to encourage common people to take part in. More and more common people become interested in the event and attend it. The marathon is an event that challenge ourselves. If we take some professional trainings and make a scientific plan to run for a longer distance gradually, it is possible.

Since then, there have been many more exciting marathons.In fact, you don´t have to wait for the Olympic Games to run or watch a marathon, as there are marathons in over sixty countries and hundreds of cities around the world today. One of the most famous marathons is in New York, and is watched by two million people around the streets and across the bridges of the city’s five boroughs (纽约市的行政区), and past New York’s famous landmarks. But perhaps one of the most beautiful and extraordinary marathons ever is the Great Wall Marathon, which most competitors find is the toughest course to run.The marathon is the final Olympic event because it is thought to be the hardest. But experts believe that most people  even people who are not particularly good at sport  can run a marathon, if they train for it###Suppose you were a runner in a marathon. How would you feel in the last few meters and why###Possible answers: I must be exhausted but proud and excited, because such a long distance was my physical limit but I made it. That so many audience and friends cheered for me really excited me. I challenged myself and achieved what I had thought impossible."

He says he and his fellow study authors are strongly convinced the jellyfish was holding on to the plastic because it was trying to eat it.Past studies have shown that marine animals accidentally eating plastic debris（碎片） is a widespread problem. Scientists think animals eat it because it looks like their prey: turtles eat jellyfishlike plastic bags, and fish eat small ricesized plastic that is similar with their normal food. Ocean plastic also smells delicious to some marine animals.

Now when we use a credit card to shop online, money is spent without us seeing it. That means we are already using digital money. Using a card is much easier than searching our pockets for change. It is also safer than carrying a lot of cash.When ATM cards were first introduced, they were not accepted everywhere. But now it’s hard to live without them.

A high resolution (高清的) image could be just a few years away.Selfdriving carsUnlike a human driver, a selfdriving car won´t get distracted (分神) by a phone call, the radio or something outside the window. Sensors (探测器) and cameras on the car would allow it to stick strictly to the rules of the road and keep a safe distance from other cars. This would greatly reduce the number of road accidents.

The group warns the condition of the world's animals is worse than its earlier reports showed, telling that worldwide action is needed.The WWF is worried about the loss and damage to Earth's environment. The report gives information about more than 10,000 animal populations from 1970 to 2010. These populations are called “vertebrate species,” or animals with backbones  like fish, birds……The report shows these populations have dropped（下降）by 52 percent in just 40 years. It warns freshwater species have fallen by 76 percent, which is almost twice the loss of land and ocean species. Most of these losses are in the tropics（热带地区）, with the biggest drop in Latin America.Marco Lambertini, the WWF's International DirectorGeneral said, “there are many reasons for this. This is about losing natural habitats. This is aboutconvertingforests, grasslands, and wetlands into agriculture mainly, and it is about unsustainable use of wildlife. Illegal（非法的） hunting has been actually increasing over the last 10 years, which is the main reason for extinction(灭绝), particularly of large species.”The report also notes about the effect of human activities on the planet. Mr. Lambertini says there has been an increase in carbon dioxide gases and the pouring of nitrogen (氮) into oceans and rivers from fertilizers（化肥）used in agriculture, which certainly cannot continue.“We are consuming（消耗）one and a half times the resources available to the planet. That means we are cutting trees more quickly than they can be restored. We are fishing the oceans more quickly than fishing stocks can reproduce, and we are emitting（释放）in the atmosphere more CO2 than the natural systems can actually absorb, which is clearly not sustainable（可支撑的）.”Mr. Lambertini warns climate change affects almost everyone on the planet and that whole species may disappear if the world does not reduce the effects of humans on the climate###Which does the underlined word “converting” in paragraph 4 mean###A、protecting.B、expressing.C、Exchanging.D、Turning into "

More people were killed worldwide by natural disasters this year than have been killed in terrorism attacks（恐怖袭击） in the past 40 years combined.“It just seemed like it was backtoback and it came in waves,” said Craig Fugate, who heads the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Think critically about it and thenwrite down your opinions as well as the reasons###Possible answers:Yes. I agree. According to the passage, human suffered from deaths and damage in 2010 because of natural disasters. However, human’s behavior itself, such as poor constructionin Haiti,also increased thedeaths andsuffering.I think it is the truth. If people in Haiti had lived in anti-seismic buildings, there wouldn’t have been so much loss. Apart from the poor construction, in my opinion, humanshave many other wrong behaviors which destroy the natural environment and increase the damage caused by natural disaster.For example, deforestation leads to soil erosion and thereby results in sand storms and floods; automobile exhaust and plant fumes cause carbon emission, which turns out to be the main reason for greenhouse effect and global warming. As the experts said, the killer Russian heat wave might not have happened so frequently without global warming. Therefore, although natural disasters are unavoidable, what humans do willdefinitelyincrease or decrease the damage. In other words, without environment protection and proper self protection, we would suffer from more loss in front of natural disasters."

Sonya had only just attended one first aid class the day before when she found herself needing to use the skills on her threeyearold daughter Tilly.Sonya, who also has a son Emmen, attended the first aid course at Lune Park Children's Centre. Then she was faced with every parent's worst nightmare when Tilly went blue in the face and stopped breathing.Sonya said: “Tilly was playing with her brother and they were fighting over a toy. Emmen won the fight. Tilly fell backwards and her head was hit. She was face down and shaking and at first, I thought she was upset. But then I saw she was blue in the face and had stopped breathing. I reacted without thinking and immediately started using the first aid skills I had learnt the day before. I began doing mouthtomouth and chest compressions (胸外按压).

Since then, Tilly has been diagnosed (诊断) with Reflex Anoxic Seizure (反射缺氧发作). Sonya said: “The seizure can happen when there's any unexpected pain, fear or fright. It is just so lucky that the day before it happened, I had been practicing first aid. I am just so glad I did the course and learnt the first aid skills.

Give your reasons###Possible answer:I don't think we should do as the mum did. It is not to say that we should watch people dying without holding out our helping hands. What I want to express is that before we start to help, we need to make sure that we are saving people instead of hurting them further. We have seen a lot of sad stories in Wenchuan after the terrifying earthquake. Many people who came to help applied first-aid skills to the survivors. However, it was their lack of professional skills that causes many survivors to lose their health, their legs or even their lives. So, when we are not quite sure of our first-aid skills, don't do it hastily. Sometimes, it's better for us to leave the things that require special skills to specialists."

What are the solutions to the problems###Possible answer:The bike-sharing in Beijing has several problems. The first one is that the city is overloaded with shared bikes, resulting in bicycles piling up and blocking already-crowded streets and pathways. Besides, many people just leave the bikes anywhere, without giving a thought to whether they are causing an obstruction. In addition, many of the bikes are of poor quality and are easily broken, which frustrates people a lot especially when they are in a hurry. To solve the problems requires the cooperation of all those involved. Local governments must restrict the number of shared bikes according to the people's needs. Second, the government needs to establish areas where the bicycles can be left and ensure bicycle lanes are properly used. Finally，the bike companies need to improve the quality of their products, review and strengthen their user rules, while the users need to better learn and obey these rules."

The whale is not too far away, father said you could make two trips.”“Two trips?Ishall make four!”Kak said.It was wonderful to ride along the track, over the hard snow, to the whale. Once there, Kak had to work hard,gettingthe big, rough pieces of frozen meat on to the sledge. Andjustas it was growing dark, he proudly brought home his third load(装载).He called Noashak,“You said‘two loads’.Ihave brought three!”“Three! That’s nothing!”cried Noashak.“You said that you could bring four!You are too much afraid to go back for another load now.”Kak did not like this. So once more he got on the sledgeandheaded for the whale.By the time Kak reached the whale, night was coming on. He heard thecryof the wolves far off. He thought, too, of the big white bear, and his hands began to shake. The night grew blacker, and the wind colder. He would stay no longer.All at once, the sledge slippedand turnedupside down.It sent Kak flyingto the ground.Kak soon stood up, and looked around, trying to see his home.

Then Kak lay down with a furry dog on each side of him, and was soon fast asleep.When he opened his eyes again, he saw the yellow sunlight shining through the roof of his house. Then he heard a sound of knocking, it was his father!As Kak sat on the sledge, he laughed at his funny little house. It was far from being round and smooth like the ones his father built.“Butit did stand up,”he said,“and it saved us from bears and wolves, and from being frozen.”When he reached home, Kak was a real hero. Never again did Noashakmake fun ofhim about beingafraidof anything###What was Kak asked to do one morning###He was asked to go to the dead whale and bring some of the flesh his fatherhad cut up."

The story begins with Santiago having gone 84 days without catching a fish, and now being seen as the worst form of unluckiness. He is so unlucky that his young apprentice, Manolin, has been forbidden by his parents to sail with him.②On the eightyfifth day, Santiago takes his rowboat into the Gulf Stream, sets his lines and, by noon, has his bait（诱饵）taken by a big fish that he is sure is amarlin.Unable tohaul inthe great marlin, Santiago is instead pulled by the marlin, and two days and nights pass with Santiago holding onto the line. Though wounded by the struggle and in pain, Santiago expresses a compassionate appreciation for his opponent, often referring to him as a brother. He also determines that, because of the fish's great dignity, no one shall deserve to eat the marlin.③On the third day, the fish begins to circle the boat. Santiago, worn out and faint, uses all his remaining strength to pull the fish onto its side and kill the marlin with a harpoon（鱼叉）. Santiago fastens the marlin to the side of his boat and heads home, thinking about the money the fish will bring him at the market and how many people he will feed.④On his way to shore, sharks are attracted to the marlin's blood, and by nightfall the sharks have almost eaten the marlin's entire body, leaving a skeleton consisting mostly of its backbone, its tail and its head. Santiago knows that he is entirely unlucky and defeated. Upon reaching the shore before dawn on the next day, Santiago struggles to his shack, carrying the heavy mast on his shoulder, leaving the fish skeleton on the shore.

B、Sharks almost eat the marlin's entire body.C、He is wounded by the big fish in the struggle.D、He almost loses all his strength and feels weak. "

9529_0,"阅读下面短文根据短文意思选择最佳答案ASTRONAUTS on board the International Space Station (ISS) recently made history by taking bites of some red romaine lettuce (生菜). They became the first humans to eat food that was grown entirely in space.The lettuce was planted on the ISS in a small greenhouse called “Veggie”, which uses LED lights to help plants grow in space.First, the astronauts cleaned the lettuce with special sanitizing wipes (消毒纸巾) and then ate it with some salad dressing.“It was one small bite for man, one giant leap (飞跃) for our journey to Mars,” one astronaut Scott Kelly later posted on social media. Space vegetables are a part of the NASA experiment called “Veg01”, a study on how plants grow away from the effects of Earth’s gravity. It will allow astronauts to grow and eat their own food during long space explorations.“If we´re ever going to go to Mars someday, we´re going to need a spacecraft that is much more selfsustainable (自给自足的) in its food supply,” said Kelly. Growing fresh plants on a spacecraft may also provide oxygen (氧气) and help keep astronauts alive, NASA said.“Veg01” started in May 2014. The first batch(一批) of vegetables took 33 days to grow in space before they were taken back to Earth for a safety check. After making sure it was safe to eat, astronauts planted a second batch on July 8. They let the plant grow for another 33 days and were then able to eat it.

The introduction is also detailed and easy to understand. The writer lists different ways to take a staycation and uses specific examples to make it easy to understand.

You´ve probably just got one rubbish bin where everything goes. But it´s a good idea to place a special bin for recycling paper. Then, when it goes full, you can empty it into a larger recycling bin in the kitchen. You can also put a small recycling bin in the bathroom for any useless paper there.Before you throw an item into the recycling bin, stop and think if you can use that item again. Take plastic items that contain yoghurt, for example. After eating what´s in them, you can clean them and store them in a cupboard, and later you can use them for storing another food item. You can do the same with the glass jars, too. You can also share your recycling advice with your neighbors.If you decide to put an item in the recycling bin, it´s very important to follow this method. If it had food or drink in it, you must clean it before you put it in the recycling bin. It can´t be recycled with food still in it. You should place the item under the running water for a few seconds to clean it. This saves time for the workers in the recycling center. Then they can use their time doing more important work.The last thing to remember isdon´t give up! You mustn´t just do recycling for a month and then return to your old habits. You can also continue to find other ways to recycle. So make recycling your new habit, and get others involved as well!###How many steps are mentioned in this essay to recycle? What are they###Five.

But can you imagine what it would be like to have two suns over your head?Well, the Kepler47 system (星系) does have two stars in its sky, according to a discovery in the Science Journal.The new system was found by NASA´s Kepler space telescope. It is about 5,000 lightyears away from us. One of the stars is similar to our sun, but the other is much smaller and less than 1 percent as bright.In fact, systems with two stars are quite common. “Unlike our sun, many stars are part of multiplestar (多个恒星的) systems where two or more stars orbit (环绕运行) one another,” said a scientist from NASA´s Research Center in the US.Scientists are more surprised that there could be two planets (行星) in the Kepler47 system because it is very hard for planets to form in such a complex environment.One of the planets, Kepler47b, is closer to the stars. It´s three times larger than Earth. The other one, Kepler47c, is about 4.5 times the size of Earth. Most importantly, Kepler47c is neither too close nor too far away from the stars. It means the planet won´t be too hot or cold.

It also has a simple but very beautiful synagogue. A synagogue is a Jewish temple.Here is another piece of advice for you, just in case you ever visit Prague. Try the beer. The Czech Republic is famous for having the best beer in the world###According to the passage, what kind of life do you think Jewish people lived in the past in Prague? How do you know###Possible answers:I think the Jewish once lived a hard life in the past in Prague. At that time they had no right to decide where they lived. They were forced to live in the Jewish Quarter. And compared with other parts of Prague, the streets in the Jewish Quarter are narrower and the buildings are smaller. So their living conditions were not very good. So from these, we can know the life of the Jewish was hard in the past."
9582_4,"Read the passage and finish the following tasks.Prague（布拉格）is the capital of the Czech Republic（捷克共和国）, and it's in the center of Europe. Prague is a place where the eastern and western parts of Europe meet. The cultures of Eastern and Western Europe are quite different, but both of them have greatly influenced Prague. And of course, Prague has its own unique culture as well.During World War II, many European cities wereheavily bombed.However, Prague suffered very little damage during the war. As a result, all of its ancient buildings are still complete.Old Town Square is the number one stop for tourists visiting Prague. The square is more than 800 years old; if you go there, remember that some amazing things have happened there in the past. For example, on the ground you can see 27 crosses.

After reading the whole passage, do you agree with the writer? Tell your reasons###Possible answers:After reading the whole passage and learning something about Prague,Icompletely agree with the writer. Although both Old Town Square and the Jewish Quarter can tell us something about the past, it is Old Town Square that can take us into the ancient world to experience the ancient culture. Old Town Square is more than 800 years old and has seen big events.The 27 crosses show one of them. The 600 year-old clock with beautiful religious carvings in the old town hall building tells us what wonderful technique the builder had and what a miserable life he lived because of that selfish and cruel government.SoIagree with the writer. IfIwere to visit Prague,Iwould certainly visit Old Town Square first."

From Beijing's Forbidden City to Sichuan province's Bao'en Temple, it has helped many of China's oldest buildings withstand earthquakes and natural disasters.Dougong is a system of wooden brackets that can support the overhanging roofs commonly found in Chinese architecture. The underlying physics are simple: The interlocking brackets transfer weight to vertical columns, lessening the strain on the horizontal beams. Nails or fasteners are not required.This support system meant that even buildings made from mud could bear the weight of a heavy temple roof. It also meant that wooden frames became much more flexible while still maintaining their structural integrity even in structures of substantial height. As well as giving the illusion that buildings are ""floating"" in their frames, this flexibility offers protection against the forces of nature.Over time, dougong has become as much about decoration as engineering, according to Nancy Steinhardt, professor of East Asian art at the University of Pennsylvania.

9606_3,"阅读题阅读短文回答问题Architects have long turned to the past for inspiration. In this age of glass and steel, however, they're more likely to be looking for aesthetic influence than technical knowhow. But an ancient Chinese construction technique called dougong is a notable exception.Consisting of a series of interlocking brackets, this building innovation may be more than 2,500 years old. From Beijing's Forbidden City to Sichuan province's Bao'en Temple, it has helped many of China's oldest buildings withstand earthquakes and natural disasters.Dougong is a system of wooden brackets that can support the overhanging roofs commonly found in Chinese architecture. The underlying physics are simple: The interlocking brackets transfer weight to vertical columns, lessening the strain on the horizontal beams. Nails or fasteners are not required.This support system meant that even buildings made from mud could bear the weight of a heavy temple roof. It also meant that wooden frames became much more flexible while still maintaining their structural integrity even in structures of substantial height. As well as giving the illusion that buildings are ""floating"" in their frames, this flexibility offers protection against the forces of nature.Over time, dougong has become as much about decoration as engineering, according to Nancy Steinhardt, professor of East Asian art at the University of Pennsylvania. ""As one of the mostrecognizable symbols of Chinese architecture, the use of dougong always references not just Chinese architecture, but China (itself).""Engineering has come a long way since dougong was last in fashion. But modernday designers are now adopting the technique to produce stunning and sturdy works of architecture. The China Art Museum in Shanghai which was built as the China Pavilion for the 2010 World Expois a modern example. The $220 millionmuseum's topheavy design uses dougongstyle brackets to support its everwidening and seeminglyimplausible upper reaches.For architect Terrence Curry, the appeal of using ancient methods is about finding something that can ""speak to craftsmanship and speak to traditional Chinese identity."" His 2015 structure Dougong Cube, was constructed using traditionalstyle brackets and more than 2,000 laminated boards.""We had to put screws into the joints, because we were (using plywood, which is) different from solid wood. It doesn't expand and contract the way that wood does."" he said in a phone interview. ""The shape and function of dougong is directly related to the properties of wood, and the extraordinary ability of the craftsmen who made these great buildings. In this way, there is little need for 'decoration' because the structure and the proportion of the building give it its distinctive look.""###According to architect Terrence Curry, “the appeal of using ancient methods is about finding something that can ‘speak to craftsmanship and speak to traditional Chinese identity.’ ”What's your understanding of it###The charm ofancient Chinese construction techniques and methods, for exampledougong, provides the current architects withinspiration, not just inaesthetic influencebut also intechnical know-how.The reason for using theseancient methodsis that they candemonstrate the extraordinary ability of the craftsmen who made these great buildingsand they are typicalsymbolsand elementsrepresenting thetraditional Chinese identity.The proper combination of these ancient methods and modern construction techniques makes buildingsrecognizable symbols of Chinese architecture."
