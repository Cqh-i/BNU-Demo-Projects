8055,"Long ago, Bear had a long bushy tail. He was so proud of his tail that he showed it off to everyone. The other animals would say, ""Bear, you have the most beautiful tail of all. ""This made Fox unhappy. He thought his own long tail was much better than Bear's. So, Fox made a plan. Fox knew that Bear loved fish more than anything else. He cut out a hole in the ice. Then, he fished all day long until he had a lot of fish. When he heard Bear coming, Fox hid the fishing pole and put his tail into the cold, icy water. Just then, Bear walked by the lake. He couldn't believe what he saw. “Fox.” he said. ""How did you get all those nice fish? ""It was easy, ""said Fox. ""I caught them with my tail. I'll show you. But let's find a new place for you. I think I've caught all the fish here. ""So Fox led Bear to a different place and cut out a new hole.“Here is your new hole, Bear.” said Fox. “Turn around and put your tail into the water. Soon a fish will bite it. "" Bear did everything Fox said. ""I cannot see the hole. How will I know if I catch fish?"" asked Bear. Fox said, ""I will hide so the fish don't see me When I see a fish bite your tail, I will shout. Then you can pull the fish out of the water. Don't move until I tell you to. ""Bear nodded his head.Bear waited and waited. He was so tired that he soon fell asleep. The ice got thicker when Bear slept all day and all night. Fox waited by the tree. At last it was time, Fox shouted “Now, Bear!” Bear woke up and pulled his tail, but it wouldn’t move. Bear pulled and pulled, until...SNAP!“My tail”, cried Bear. The fishing hole was gone. There in the ice was Bears tail. Fox pointed Bear's new short tail and laughed. ""What a silly little tail for a great. big Bear, ""said Fox. Bear was so sad.

8201,"Go, commonly known in China as weiqi, is a board game for two players that needs logical (逻辑的) strategies. To win, the player must use black and white playing pieces to surround more field than the other player. The game was invented in China more than 2500 years ago. It enjoys a wide fan base, mostly in East Asiabut it is becoming more popular in other areas of the world.Schreiber, vice chair of Berlin Go Association, was introduced to the game 16 year ago, but thought the game rather boring at first. Similarly, Urban, chair of Berlin Go Association, accidentally discovered a book on Go on his mother's bookshelf when he was 37 years old. “I tried to understand the rules because I love board games and I did not get it,”added Urban. But they both found the game more and more interesting after practice. “It's like speaking to another but with your hands. You make a very direct message,” explained Schreiber.Schreiber, recommended children learn Go because he believed it could beneficial for them. “They learn that there is always someone stronger and it's okay to lose. They learn how to improve from their mistakes and say tomorrow will be better than today,” he explained.To the experienced players, Go can be very addictive, as it carries meanings not just in leisure, but also in culture. Many are too quick to judge other people's culture. Confucius said, “Tell me, I'll forget; Show me, I may remember; Involve me, and I will understand.” With Go, people only get stronger if they play against different players. With culture, one need to go and talk to people, even better if in their language. If you can't, maybe it's enough to use the Go board as the language.As cooperation between China and Germany deepens in many aspects if life, efforts have been made to further popularize Go in Europe. The European Go Congress has been hosting annual competitions since 1983. Training courses are offered, and professional players from China are invited to deliver lectures for game lovers in Europe.61When was Go invented in China$$$ more than 2,500 years ago"

8256,"Kak was a bright, happy Eskimo boy. One morning, his father asked him to go to the dead whale and bring some of the flesh he had cut up.Kak was very happy at the chance of taking the sledge out by himself. He soonpickedtwo dogs, and took his father's snowknife just in case he had to spend the night outside.His sister, Noashak, saw this and made fun of him,“You are being funny. The whale is not too far away, father said you could make two trips.”“Two trips?Ishall make four!”Kak said.It was wonderful to ride along the track, over the hard snow, to the whale. Once there, Kak had to work hard,gettingthe big, rough pieces of frozen meat on to the sledge. Andjustas it was growing dark, he proudly brought home his third load(装载).He called Noashak,“You said‘two loads'.Ihave brought three!”“Three! That's nothing!”cried Noashak.“You said that you could bring four!You are too much afraid to go back for another load now.”Kak did not like this. So once more he got on the sledgeandheaded for the whale.By the time Kak reached the whale, night was coming on. He heard thecryof the wolves far off. He thought, too, of the big white bear, and his hands began to shake. The night grew blacker, and the wind colder. He would stay no longer.All at once, the sledge slippedand turnedupside down.It sent Kak flyingto the ground.Kak soon stood up, and looked around, trying to see his home. Alas, his heart sank, as he had missed the track!As he sat on the sledge, wondering what to do,hiseyes fell upon the snowknife. Heknewwhat he was going to dohe was going to make a house!It was hard work, and Kak worked like a man, and thelittle beehive housewas finally made. Then Kak lay down with a furry dog on each side of him, and was soon fast asleep.When he opened his eyes again, he saw the yellow sunlight shining through the roof of his house. Then he heard a sound of knocking, it was his father!As Kak sat on the sledge, he laughed at his funny little house. It was far from being round and smooth like the ones his father built.“Butit did stand up,”he said,“and it saved us from bears and wolves, and from being frozen.”When he reached home, Kak was a real hero. Never again did Noashakmake fun ofhim about beingafraidof anything.What was Kak asked to do one morning$$$He was asked to go to the dead whale and bring some of the flesh his fatherhad cut up"

8813,"Kak was a bright, happy Eskimo boy. One morning, his father asked him to go to the dead whale and bring some of the flesh he had cut up.Kak was very happy at the chance of taking the sledge out by himself. He soonpickedtwo dogs, and took his father's snowknife just in case he had to spend the night outside.His sister, Noashak, saw this and made fun of him,“You are being funny. The whale is not too far away, father said you could make two trips.”“Two trips?Ishall make four!”Kak said.It was wonderful to ride along the track, over the hard snow, to the whale. Once there, Kak had to work hard,gettingthe big, rough pieces of frozen meat on to the sledge. Andjustas it was growing dark, he proudly brought home his third load(装载).He called Noashak,“You said‘two loads'.Ihave brought three!”“Three! That's nothing!”cried Noashak.“You said that you could bring four!You are too much afraid to go back for another load now.”Kak did not like this. So once more he got on the sledgeandheaded for the whale.By the time Kak reached the whale, night was coming on. He heard thecryof the wolves far off. He thought, too, of the big white bear, and his hands began to shake. The night grew blacker, and the wind colder. He would stay no longer.All at once, the sledge slippedand turnedupside down.It sent Kak flyingto the ground.Kak soon stood up, and looked around, trying to see his home. Alas, his heart sank, as he had missed the track!As he sat on the sledge, wondering what to do,hiseyes fell upon the snowknife. Heknewwhat he was going to dohe was going to make a house!It was hard work, and Kak worked like a man, and thelittle beehive housewas finally made. Then Kak lay down with a furry dog on each side of him, and was soon fast asleep.When he opened his eyes again, he saw the yellow sunlight shining through the roof of his house. Then he heard a sound of knocking, it was his father!As Kak sat on the sledge, he laughed at his funny little house. It was far from being round and smooth like the ones his father built.“Butit did stand up,”he said,“and it saved us from bears and wolves, and from being frozen.”When he reached home, Kak was a real hero. Never again did Noashakmake fun ofhim about beingafraidof anything.What was Kak asked to do one morning$$$He was asked to go to the dead whale and bring some of the flesh his fatherhad cut up"
